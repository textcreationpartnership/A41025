         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> hath told us, That pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Affliction, and to keep unſpotted from the World; and that the Wiſdom which is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of Mercy, without Partiality, and without Hypocriſie; what then muſt be ſaid of the modern <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, which owns and maintains ſeveral treacherous, cruel and bloody Principles, according to which the Practices of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have been frequently conformed, being trecherous, cruel and bloody? is that pure and from above? Nothing leſs; but we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be from beneath, therefore impure, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and falſe.</p>
            <p>Yet the great Brags of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſounding in our ears, that they have Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Succeſſion for their Religion, and that it has deſcended unto them through the Current of all Ages, even from the Primitive Times: This is
<pb facs="tcp:109869:3"/> the main Pillar wherewith they endeavour to ſupport their tottering Religion; and the great Argument they uſe to prove the Truth, which they injuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſly claim as pertinent unto it, while they do make this Plea, they think themſelves ſufficiently armed for Offence and Defence, and do ſhout for the Battel, aſſuring themſelves Victory over all Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>But when we do demand how they prove their great Brags to be true, they tell us, that the Obligation of proving, does not lie on their ſide, but it belongs to us to diſprove what they ſay; The greateſt Flouriſh which they make for themſelves, is, by propounding of Querie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſuch as my Antagoniſt hath propounded, and ſuch as cannot certainly be determined either in the Affirmative or the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, If thou wert poſſeſſed of an Eſtate in Land, unto which thy Title is pleaded to be Illegal, and that thy Poſſeſſion was gotten by fraud or violence, thy own natural Reaſon ſhould adviſe thee, and to avoid a tedious Suit, Charity ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige thee (I am ſure the Court of Equity will compel thee) to produce thy Evidences, and to ſhew thy Deeds to make good thy Title; to ask what hour, or what day, or what month, or what year the fraud or the violence was acted, and the intruſion made, will never procure the Verdict of a Jury, and the Sentence of a Judge to juſtifie the Tenure.</p>
            <p>Here thou haſt the great Brags of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> examined, and proved to have no ſtrength to produce any effect for their advantage; it is vanity in the Abſtract for them to boaſt of Antiquity and Succeſſion, while th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y want that Religion which was profeſſed by the Primitive Chriſtians, and do own and maintain Doctrines and Practices which were never warranted by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, and the Authority of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:109869:3"/>
            <p>That my Diſcourſe comes forth in an homely Dreſs, thou muſt take this to be the reaſon; thou canſt not expect to find any better fruit than the Tree is able to produce. So many have my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and Diſadvantages, and Impediments been, that had not ſeveral weighty Conſiderations over-ruled me, I had not appeared in publick after this manner; Providence thought fit to order me to live under a Sacrilegious Popiſh Patron, whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors began, and he continues ſo great an Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches Revenues, that the Pittance which is left, is not able to afford a Competency for a convenient Livelihood; for if the Back be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Belly grumbles for want of Meat; and if the Belly be filled, the Back complains for want of Cloathing; there is not enough to ſupply the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of both, ſo that there is nothing to be ſpared to purchaſe a Library, which is a very great help to aſſiſt in the courſe of the Miniſtry, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of Controverſies with the common Enemy; but if the number of my Books were equal to the Vatican-Library, there is little leiſure to be ſpared for converſing with ſuch Companions, alas, I muſt ſpend my time in caſting about, and contriving how to proportion my little Barrel of Meal, and to draw out my little Cruiſe of Oyl to the greateſt Advantage, that it may reach to anſwer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Cravings of thoſe that are concerned to have a ſhare of it.</p>
            <p>Help, O Mighty and Religious King, help ye Learned and Pious Biſhops; ye wiſe Senators and Judges of the Nation; ſuffer not the Patrimony of the Church to be devoured by Popiſh Laicks, who thirſt after our deſtruction more than the chaſed Hart pants after the Water-brooks, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to ſee that day wherein we ſhould have (if they
<pb facs="tcp:109869:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> might have it ſo) neither Church nor Being.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid (as the Town-Clerk in the <hi>Acts</hi> ſaid to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his fellow-Craftsmen, The Law is open, and there are Deputies, let them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead one another; I ask whether a Pigmy (though his Cauſe be never ſo good) be an equal Match to encounter with a Giant? And is there any hope of Succeſs for him in combating with ſuch an Enemy? Is there no other courſe to be found to recover the alienated Rights of the Church? Muſt a poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, that has not Neceſſaries for a convenient Livelihood, be forced to contend with a powerful and rich Patron, whoſe Purſe is able to purchaſe that <hi>Elixir</hi> that can turn Braſs into Gold, and Lead into Silver, and make the moſt bright ſhining Cauſe to appear as a dark Lanthorn: Money is the Queen-Regent, what can it not do? It is ſaid, <hi>Pecunia omnia poteſt;</hi> and it is too often known, that the Verdict of a Jury is byaſſed by the ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Purſe; and all do know that the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaders of the Law will not open their mouths, to ſpeak in the beſt Cauſe, unleſs their Tongues be gilded with Gold, or tipt with Silver, which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of an indigent Incumbent is not able to perform.</p>
            <p>And what can be expected from one that is thus ſhattered and broken in his Fortunes? is his dejected, heartleſs, and therefore unactive Spirit able to produce any thing in relation to Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, fit to be preſented to the publick view? But theſe following Conſiderations over-ruled my dull and backward hand to put my unskilful Pen upon motion; firſt, That if a Servant have but half a Talent allowed him, he is not to lap it up in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and bury it in the Earth, but to employ and improve it to his Maſter's uſe. Secondly, That
<pb facs="tcp:109869:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> God accepts of the Will far the Deed, and does not expect that the cock ſhould run more water then is put into the ciſtern. Thirdly that at the building of <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, all were not maſter builders, but there were inferiour Workmen that contributed much to the erecting of that glorious ſtructure; beſides all this, the neceſſity of the People committed to my Charge, required ſome Armour to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Aſſaults of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Agents, there being many ſuch ſurrounding us on either ſide, and many ſuch reſiding within the compaſs of our Neighbourhood, among whom, my conceited Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is one that carries a great ſway, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds for her Activity, to propagate the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; whenſoever any opportunity falls out, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for her purpoſe, ſhe is ready, not only to ſtrain her Perſon, but alſo to ſend forth her active E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries to fill People with the poyſonous Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>WHile you have been writing of your Queries, you forgot what you promiſed in the Title, you promiſed points of Religion; Queries are not Points; indeed the determination on either ſide, may in ſome reſpect be termed ſuch, but while they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined, and do remain Queries, they are not ſuch.</p>
               <p>If you mean by Points of Religion, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Queries on either ſide, then I muſt ask you, what you mean by Points of Religion; whether ſuch Truths as are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be known, or Truths of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Allay, ſuch as are convenient for ſome reſpects to be known?</p>
               <p>If you mean Truths of the firſt ſort, there is as little affinity between your Title and your Queries, as there is between me and you, and that is none at all; for none of theſe Queries are neceſſary to be known, either in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative or the Negative, with either a general and confuſed knowledge, or that knowledge which is diſtinct and particular; for you and I and others may worſhip God, and ſo advance his Glory, and come to be ſaved without it; and I ſay farther, that if your Queries be made concerning a diſtinct and particular knowledge, if ever we ſhall be ſaved, we ſhall be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; there is much required to compleat this
<pb facs="tcp:109869:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> Knowledge, than you, or I, or any other can gain by the beſt Intelligencers we have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>
               <p>If you mean Truths of the ſecond ſort, pray, let me aſſume the boldneſs as to ask you, why you are ſo injurious to the common ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to load their Heads with unneceſſary Poſitions, and to puzzle their Brains with ſuch like Queries? will you imitate the Scribes and Phariſees, to teach for Doctrines (as they did the Commandments of men, ſo you) the private Conceits of men.</p>
               <p>To your Queries in general, I anſwer, firſt you take a Journey of three miles about, while a Journey of one would have ſerved better, and brought you ſooner home; it would have ſaved you ſome pains in Querying, and me in Anſwering, and been as much, yea more to purpoſe, if you had, inſtead of making three Queries, propounded but one; namely this, whether the Religion now profeſſed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in <hi>England,</hi> be the ſame that was brought into <hi>England</hi> at its firſt Converſion, and ſo the ſame that was taught by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? I do not ſee any reaſon for this long Vagary, why you ſhould go about, to know what Religion S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſed, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the <hi>Britains</hi> in his time profeſſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yours agrees to his, his agrees to theirs; if I ſhould grant you ſo long Succeſſion for your Religion, what advantage could you make of it? if you reaſon after this manner, to confirm the Truth you pretend for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, my Father, and my Grandfather, and my great Grandfather, and ſo onward, until you come to <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and the ancient
<pb facs="tcp:109869:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>Britains</hi> were of this Religion, therefore it is true; a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Turk</hi> may reaſon with the ſame probability: or if you reaſon thus, our Religion is as ancient as <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> therefore it is true; a <hi>Turk</hi> may plead as great Antiquity for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a <hi>Jew</hi> greater for his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all theſe Queries I ſuppoſe you are on the Affirmative ſide, and that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us to be on the Negative; pray let me ask you, which in reaſon ſhould firſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Affirmative or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? If your Affirmative ſhould firſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as you muſt grant, if you have the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a man; why will you deny to put your Shoulders under the Burden, and lay it wholly upon ours: It ſeems you are ſomewhat like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſters, you would have us to make Brick, while you would be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; you would be putting of Queries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, while we muſt be labouring our Brains in proving unto you: Let me propound a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Requeſt, and deſire you once to be as forward in practice, as you are in precept; and as ready to prove as you are to quere; and to prove the Affirmative of theſe Queries, and to ſet down a ſubſtantial proof, ſuch as may be convincing to the non-prejudging Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; I think I may allow you a longer time to do this, than the Elephant is in bringing forth her young.</p>
               <p>To the firſt Query, my Anſwer is Negative; we may preſume that <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Religion was the ſame which his Maſter, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> profeſſed, and your Religion differs from his in theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the Canon of the Scripture, the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb facs="tcp:109869:7"/> of the Scripture, the Reading of the Scripture, the Real Preſence, Private Maſs, Communion in both kinds, Merit of good Works, Veneration of Images the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, his Doctrine in theſe being the ſame that is maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as can be evidenced out of his Writings.</p>
               <p>To the Second, my Anſwer is likewiſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; it is probable it was not: my Reaſons are theſe; becauſe thoſe ancient <hi>Britains</hi> told <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, that they had a Biſhop of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom they were to ſubmit; therefore they would have nothing to do with the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> Beſides, they rejected <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> Traditions; would they have done ſo, had their Religion been the ſame with his? For which, the Monk ſtirred up the wrath of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> againſt them, who raiſed his Forces, and came (<hi>Auſtin</hi> being in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and deſtroyed about twelve hundred of them: howſoever this Fact of his may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, it was a horrid Fact; but much more wicked would it have been judged to be, had thoſe murdered <hi>Britains</hi> been of his Religion.</p>
               <p>To the Third, my Anſwer is this; That neither you, nor I can determine poſitively on either ſide, unleſs we do (as he that writ of the World in the Moon, did) take upon us to write of things ſo far diſtant from us, that they cannot come within the compaſs of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we having no certain Records to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what were the Tenets maintained by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ancient <hi>Britains:</hi> We have ſo much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them, as to think well of them; and have great reaſon to believe, that they were far more Religious and Holy than <hi>Auſtin</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Monk was.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109869:7"/>
               <p>To your Cautional Concluſion, Firſt, I ſay, that I have toyled my Brains, and turned the Words every way, to make ſence of them, and to reconcile their Contradictions, and yet the work is to do: a Change you ſay, in the aforeſaid points; I find no foreſaid points, but Queries; and how to ſhew a Change in thoſe Queries, unleſs you would have me to propound them after another manner, and in another ſhape, I do not apprehend; nor yet to ſhew a Change in points of Faith, where there are no points of Faith to ſhew a Change in.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you imply your ſelf to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better of this Poſition, That a Difference in Religions made by Ceremonies, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; what mean you then by thoſe Loads of needleſs Ceremonies, which are laid upon your Religion, which have made the very Axle-tree to crack; are they uſed to no purpoſe? why is the Uſe of your many needleſs Ceremonies preſſed with ſuch abſolute Neceſſity, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be obſerved, there is no obtaining of eternal Salvation, while the Uſe of them is to no purpoſe? it ſeems that you confeſs, that while you fall out with us, for rejecting your Holy Water, and your Beads, and your Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and your Unctions, and your Aſhes, and your Spittings, and ſuch like Stuff, you fall out with us for things that are uſed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I thank you for this fair acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth, though it dropped una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares from your Pen, and do promiſe, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I meet with an opportunity, to return your Courteſie.</p>
               <p>But what will you ſay, if I can prove that a Difference made in Religion by Ceremonies,
<pb facs="tcp:109869:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> doth alter the Nature of Religion? Certainly this will be to purpoſe, and no hard Task to undergo; when the Compoſition of Religion is like unto that Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in his Dream, part of Gold, part of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, part of Iron, part of Braſs, part of Clay; when Religion is made up, part of neceſſary Truths, part of ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, when the Uſe of Ceremonies (by a ſtrange Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis) is converted into Acts of Religion; when it is maintained, that <hi>ex fide</hi> they muſt be uſed, becauſe without the Uſe of them, neither God is duly worſhipped, nor Religion truly exerciſed, as it is now in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> this Change by Ceremonies alters Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from that Nature it had when it was made up of one ſound Mettal, in its original Purity.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe you have been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Queries, let me aſſume liberty to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate you a little, and to propound as many Queries unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether God is to have the whole Glory of the work of Man's Salvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether Chriſt deſerves to have the whole Glory of mediating and interceding for Sinners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether it be the ſafeſt way for Man to caſt himſelf down unto the loweſt duſt of Humility, before the footſtool of God, and to acknowledge his own worthleſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</p>
               <p>If you grant me the Affirmative of theſe three Queries, as you muſt do, unleſs you will bring the Guilt of Blaſphemy upon your ſelf, I make no queſtion, but to improve them to be powerful Engines to batter down a great part of the Structure of your Religion.</p>

               <p>I Perceive, by the tenour of your Diſcourſe, in your large Anſwer to my <hi>Brief Note concerning points of Religion,</hi> that you fancy rather to lie in ambuſh, catching at mens Words, by wilfully miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109869:9"/> their Senſe, than to give a clear, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and ſatisfactory Anſwer to the Queſtion propoſed: For the greateſt part of your whole ſheet of Paper, conſiſts of nothing elſe but verbal flouriſhes, intermixt with Erudition and exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Language, with which you beat the Air more than your Adverſary: Truly this way is neither Edificative to the Reader, nor Satisfactory to the Opponent. You are not ignorant, that it is the chiefe part of a Polemick, to wave verbal flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and with ſolid proof (drawn from Reaſon or Authority) anſwer the Queſtion propoſed; otherwiſe the greateſt part of time and paper, would be ſpent in fighting only with ſhadows; and the reſult would be, <hi>parturiunt montes naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ridiculus mus,</hi> whilſt in the mean time the whole ſubſtance of the Queſtion would, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be paſſed in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to avoid this inconvenience of a verbal Ingagement, which would never have an end, words being ſubject to as many Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as men have fancies; I will only Anſwer thoſe few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paragraphs in your large Diſcourſe which come nigheſt the Mark, and touch the Queſtion propoſed.</p>

               <p>To which you Anſwer, firſt, That ſeeing I am of the Affirmative part, you wonder much that I did not rather prove, than demand: <hi>Which to do</hi> (ſay you) <hi>with a ſubſtantial proof, ſuch as may be convincing to the non-prejudging underſtanding, will require in me, a longer time than the Elephant is in bringing forth her Young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, The reaſon why I did demand, and not prove, was not any difficulty (as you imagine) that I perceived in ſo eaſie an enterprize; it was only to ſee, whether you would grant or deny. For if you grant; then <hi>habeo intentum:</hi> For, <hi>if our Religion be the ſame with</hi> Auſtins, <hi>his with the</hi> Britains, <hi>and theirs with that which was firſt planted in</hi> England; <hi>it muſt neceſſarily follow, that ours is the true Religion.</hi> If you deny; then I have the Teſtimony of many of your learned Proteſtants againſt you; which Sir (at leaſt with you) ought to be a ſubſtantial and convincing proof to a non-prejudging underſtanding: For, as your learned <hi>Whittaker</hi> doth teſtifie, <hi>De Eccleſia Controver. 2. Queſt. 5. Cap. 14. Firmum ſit neceſſe eſt Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum illud, quod ſumitur ex adverſariorum confeſſione, &amp;c. efficax enim erit adverſariorum ipſorum contra ipſos teſtimonium, &amp;c. &amp; quidem fateor veritatem etiam e ſuis inimicis teſtimonium extorquere, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you will only vouchſafe to peruſe the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that learned Book, Entituled, <hi>The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Apology for the Roman Church,</hi> you ſhall meet with undeniable Teſtimonies of our learned. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, aſſerting the Affirmative of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Queſtion, and conſequently muſt be forced to confeſs, that I ſhall not require ſo long a time to prove the ſame, as the <hi>Elephant is in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth her Young;</hi> the thing being already proved.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109869:10"/>
               <p>If perchance you be not furniſhed with this Book, be pleaſed only to peruſe that learned Treatiſe, Entituled, <hi>The Three Converſions of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and you will meet with ſubſtantial proofs to a non-prejudging Underſtanding, aſſerting the Affirmative of the aforeſaid Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond Anſwer unto the Queſtion in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is Negative: And why? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>we may preſume, that</hi> Auſtin'<hi>s Religion was the ſame that his maſter Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>profeſſed; and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion differs from yours in theſe particulars, The Canon of the Scripture; The Sufficiency of the Scripture; The Reading of the Scripture; The Real Preſence; The Private Maſs; Communion in both Kinds; Merit of Good Works; Veneration of Images; The Popes Supremacy; His Doctrine in theſe, being the ſame that is Maintained by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as can be evidenced out of his Writings.</hi> Thus you.</p>
               <p>Sir, I remember in your verbal Triumph over my Cautional Concluſion (occaſioned by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſtake, <hi>ſciens &amp; prudens,</hi> miſ-interpreting my words quite contrary to the ſenſe they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in) you told me, That you returned me many Thanks, for the courteſie which I dropt you at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares; withal promiſing, That if ever you met with an opportunity, you would return my Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. Now Sir, you have met with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and I challenge your promiſe: For, all the Courteſie that I do require, is, That you would be pleaſed to ſhew all theſe foreſaid Points (nay, rather than I ſhould impoſe too great a task upon you) or any one of them all; pick and chooſe where you pleaſe, evidenced out of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Writings. Mark (I beſeech you) your own word, <hi>Evidenced,</hi> not wreſted by your own ſiniſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; be pleaſed to ſet down the Saints
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109869:10"/> own words, or at leaſt cite the place where they are to be found; which to do, will require in you a longer time, than the <hi>Elephant is in bringing forth her Young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your third Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Religion of St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>was the ſame with that of the Britains,</hi> is alſo Negative: Your firſt Reaſon is this, Becauſe the antient <hi>Britains</hi> told <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that they had a Biſhop of their own, to whom they were to ſubmit; therefore they would have nothing to do with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, the Fountain from whence this Objection Originally ſprang, was <hi>Galfridus Monumetenſis,</hi> lib. 11. c. 7. whoſe words, if they be but duely conſidered with an impartial Judgment, allow not at all of this your inference; therefore they would have nothing to do with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for his words are theſe, <hi>There was an Abbot of</hi> Bangor, <hi>named</hi> Dynoot, <hi>that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two thouſand Monks under his charge, who anſwered to</hi> Auſtin (<hi>when he required Subjection of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Biſhops, and that they would joyn with him to convert the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation) That the</hi> Britains <hi>owed no Subjection unto him, nor would beſtow the labor of Preaching upon their Enemies, ſeeing the</hi> Britains <hi>had an Archbiſhop of their own, and that the</hi> Saxons <hi>took from them their Country, for which cauſe they hated them extreamly, nor did eſteem their Religion, nor would communicate with them more than with Dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, here is all that is to bee found in this Author to this purpoſe, which is nothing elſe (as any impartial Reader may ſee) but a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and cholerick Anſwer of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as of men afflicted and exaſperated: here is not ſo much as one word of their having nothing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109869:11"/> to do with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as you and they, the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> many years before you infer) but only that they acknowledged not the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of <hi>Auſtin</hi> over the <hi>Britains;</hi> ſeeing he was ſent only unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own Archbiſhop, was not taken away by his coming, for any thing they yet knew, but remained as before: Which Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juriſdiction between two Archbiſhops falleth out daily, even where the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is moſt acknowledged, and ſo any one that hath Eies to Read, and Judgement to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he reads, may clearly ſee, that it is a vain and malicious inference in you and the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> to infer ſo peremptorily; therefore they would have nothing to do with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> for they ſpeak as you ſee of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Authority, and not of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom we read not, that he ſhewed to them any Authority to place him over their Archbiſhop; and conſequently it is a vaine inference, which both you and the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do make out of the <hi>Britains</hi> Anſwer, that for ſo much as they admitted not of <hi>Auſtins</hi> Authority, they would have nothing to do with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your ſecond Reaſon, why St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not the ſame with that of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> is this; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>they rejected</hi> Auſtins <hi>Traditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, I believe the Reaſon, why you did not ſet down the Traditions in particular rejected by the <hi>Britains,</hi> was becauſe you cannot ſhew any one Article of Faith (which unleſs you do, your Objection is nothing to purpoſe) in which they diſſented from St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> for all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109869:11"/> the difference that was between them, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning ſome certain tollerable differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for that time; as namely, their Diſſent from the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of Baptiſm and keeping of <hi>Eaſter;</hi> which latter, as your learned <hi>Oſiander</hi> doth teſtifie in <hi>Epitom. Cent. 2. l. 3. c.</hi> 2. was tollerated, in like manner by the Apoſtles, in regard of the known weakneſs of ſome, as for like reſpect Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was by them in like ſort tollerated, and Abſtinence from blood, and that which was ſtrangled, eſpecially preſcribed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 29. all which argue no more differenee in Articles of Faith betwixt the <hi>Britains</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> then the keeping of <hi>Eaſter, &amp;c.</hi> argued dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Articles of Faith betwixt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their new Converts.</p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Britains</hi> rejected only the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in theſe (for that time) tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable differences; in the firſt place venerable <hi>Beda,</hi> doth teſtifie, <hi>Hiſt. l. 2. c.</hi> 2. where he mentioneth this ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the <hi>Britains, Si in his tribus obtemperare mihi vultis, ut paſcha ſuo tempore celebretis, ut miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Baptizandi quo deo renaſcimur, juxta morem Romanae &amp; Apoſtolicae Eccleſiae compleatis, ut genti Anglorum una nobiſcum predicetis Verbum domini, cetera quae agitis, quamvis moribus noſtris contraria, aequanimiter cuncta tollerabimus:</hi> The like is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe following Proteſtant Writers, <hi>Hollinſhead.</hi> vol. 1. p. 103. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his Catalogue of Biſhops. p. 6. and by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Author of the Hiſtory of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1606. who <hi>l. 3. c.</hi> 13. ſaith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>The</hi> Britain-<hi>Biſhops conformed themſelves to the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109869:12"/> Rome <hi>without any difference in any thing, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remembred, ſave only in the Celebration of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which their ſo earneſt diſſenting, about theſe only matters of ſmaller importance, is moſt plainly ſignified unto us, their full Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Articles of Faith: for the <hi>Britains</hi> who contradicted St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and that ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about theſe ſo few and ſmall matters, would never have been ſilent; but much rather have withſtood in the other ſo many and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably much greater points, had they in like ſort diſagreed from him therein: nay, and their Union in Faith is yet farther proved; becauſe the <hi>Britain</hi>-Biſhops as then confeſſed, that it was the right way of Juſtice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which <hi>Auſtin</hi> taught: <hi>Tum Britones quidem confitentur intellexiſſe ſe, veram eſſe juſtitiae viam, quam proedicaret Auguſtinus:</hi> Beda <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 2. The which is farther confirmed by your learned writer Mr. <hi>Fulke,</hi> affirming that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did at the laſt obtaine the aid of the <hi>Britiſh</hi>-Biſhops, to the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Fulke <hi>in his confutation of Purgatory:</hi> p. 335.</p>
               <p>And whereas you peremptorily affirm, that <hi>Auſtin,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Britains</hi> rejected his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, inflamed the wrath of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> againſt them, who raiſed his Forces, and murthered about twelve hundred of them, the Monk himſelf being in his company, is (to ſay no worſe) a groſs miſtake; for it was not <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> but <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northumbers</hi> that committed this horrid Maſſacre of the Monks, as <hi>Beda</hi> doth teſtify. <hi>l. 2. c.</hi> 2. in theſe enſuing words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It happened afterwards that the moſt mighty King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109869:12"/> of the Engliſh men</hi> Edilfred <hi>gathering a great Army, made a foul ſlaughter of this unfaithful and naughty people, (to wit) the Monkes of</hi> Bangor; <hi>for being now ready to give the onſet of the fight, when he eſpied the Prieſts, which came together to pray for their Souldiers Warring, ſtand a part from the reſt in a ſure and ſafe place, he demanded what they were, and to what end they came thither,</hi> &amp;c. The cauſe of their coming thither, when King <hi>Edilfred</hi> had underſtood, he ſaid, <hi>If theſe men cry and call upon their God againſt us; truly, although they have no Armour, yet they fight againſt us,</hi> &amp;c. therefore he commanded his Souldiers firſt to aſſault them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So you ſee, that it was not for rejecting <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Traditions, that theſe men were ſlain (as you would fain perſwade the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant) but for coming to pray for their Army, whereby the Heathen King was mightily exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, fearing leſt their Prayers might obtain of Almighty God the victory againſt him; your own writers, <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> acknowledge the ſame.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is no leſs groſs miſtake in you ſo peremptorily to affirm, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was preſent at this ſlaughter. For <hi>Fox,</hi> your great Writer, doth confeſs that both <hi>Huntington</hi> and other Authors affirm, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was dead when this ſlaughter happened; and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Beda.</hi> l. 2. c. 2. doth teſtifie the ſame in theſe words, <hi>The Holy Biſhop St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>was himſelf long before taken out of this Life unto the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> True it is <hi>Auſtin</hi> did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (as <hi>Beda</hi> doth teſtifie in the ſame Book and Chapter) that the <hi>Britains,</hi> becauſe they were refractory, refuſing to ſubmit unto his wholſom counſel, and Preach the Word of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109869:13"/> God unto <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, ſhould ſuffer the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment of death from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which Propheſie was fulfilled in this battle, long after St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> death; <hi>In this manner</hi> (ſaith <hi>Venerable Beda</hi> having deſcribed the ſlaughter) <hi>was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Propheſie of the Holy Biſhop</hi> Auſtin, <hi>who was himſelf, long before that, taken out of this Life into the Kingdom of Heaven. And thus theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious and falſe People, ſuffered the puniſhment of temporal Death; becauſe they had refuſed and deſpiſed, the wholeſom Counſel of perpetual Life and Salvation offered unto them:</hi> Beda. l. 2. c. 2. So you ſee, that this very ſlaughter of the <hi>Monks,</hi> which you unadviſedly brought againſt us, maketh clearly againſt you; for they were ſlain, it is true, but by whom? by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent?</hi> no, but by <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northumbers,</hi> as your own Writers do tell you: Was it done by the Inſtigation of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> then preſent? no, for long before that, he was taken, out of this Life unto the Kingdom of Heaven; but why did Almighty God permit this great ſlaughter of theſe <hi>Monks?</hi> becauſe (ſaith <hi>venerable Beda) they refuſed and deſpiſed the wholeſom counſel of perpetual Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> offered to them by the Holy Biſhop St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> which makes me to ſay with your learned <hi>Whittaker, Fateor veritatem etiam e ſuis inimicis teſtimonium extorquere;</hi> and withal, leave it to the ſerious Conſideration of the Impartial Reader, whether or no, you have not dealt moſt Diſingeniouſly, in ſo peremptorily affirming theſe two groſs Miſtakes, quite contrary, not only to your own Authors, but even to vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Beda</hi> himſelf, a Witneſs in this point without Exception: For living near the time of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109869:13"/> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and withal being a Man ſo eminent, both for Vertue and Learning, that he is known by the name of <hi>Venerable;</hi> he cannot chooſe but be a ſubſtantial Proof, to convince a <hi>Non-prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Underſtanding, that you were either wilfully or ignorantly miſtaken; either whereof argueth no leſs then an indelible Stain to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your calling.</p>
               <p>Sir, I do not queſtion, but theſe ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts of your fallacious Arguments, may eaſily induce the illitterate Rabble, to believe what you pleaſe; for they looking upon you as their <hi>Oracle,</hi> placed in the Chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to dictate nothing but <hi>Verities,</hi> acquieſce without further inquiry, to what you ſay; becauſe (forſooth) <hi>ipſe dixit:</hi> But the learneder ſort, which have the leaſt Scantling in the knowledge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, cannot chooſe but <hi>ſmile in their Sleeves,</hi> to ſee one of your Profeſſion, ſo peremptorily affirm two ſuch groſs Miſtakes; and without bringing any one Authority, either modern or antient, ſave only your naked Affirmation in your own Cauſe; which I ſuppoſe, you will not preſume ſhould be looked upon, as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Proof, to convince a <hi>Non-prejudging</hi> Underſtanding; eſpecially meeting with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Teſtimony to the contrary, not only of your own Authors, but alſo of <hi>Venerable Beda;</hi> the Authority of whom, is of more force, to convince a <hi>Non-prejudging</hi> Underſtanding, then any one you can bring to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Your fourth Anſwer to this <hi>Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Religion profeſſed by the</hi> Britains, <hi>when</hi> Auſtin <hi>came into</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is this: That neither You nor I, can determine certainely on either ſide, unleſs we do (as the man did,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109869:14"/> that writ of the <hi>World in the Moon</hi>) take upon us, to write of things of ſo great Diſtance from us, as cannot come within the compaſs of our Cognizance.</p>
               <p>Sir, I can ſcarce perſwade my ſelf, the World is ſo Lunatick in the affairs of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as you pretend: If you pleaſe to peruſe the begining of the aforeſaid Book, intituled <hi>The Proteſtants Apology for the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church;</hi> you ſhall ſee, that theſe things came within the Cognizance of the <hi>Author</hi> thereof; and withal find ſubſtantial Proof, for the <hi>Affirmative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of the ſaid Queſtion, which may convince a <hi>Non-prejudging</hi> Underſtanding; and laſtly be forced to confeſs, that to prove the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of the aforeſaid Queſtions, there is not a longer time required, then the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is in bringing forth her young.</p>
               <p>After theſe your aforeſaid Anſwers, which have not ſo much as the Shadow of a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Proof, to convince a <hi>Non-prejudging</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, you propoſe unto me three <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> the Affirmative whereof (ſay you) if granted; you make no queſtion, but to improve them to be powerful Engines, to batter down the greateſt part, of the Fabrick of our Religion.</p>
               <p>Your firſt <hi>Query</hi> is this, <hi>Whether God be to have the whole glory of the Work of mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> To which I anſwer <hi>Affirmatively;</hi> but deny the ſiniſtrous Conſequence, which you uſually hence infer, <hi>Therefore no merit of good works;</hi> for though there be no Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Actions or paſſions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head; yet his Wiſdom, Will and Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and ordaineth, that his Body and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhould be Fellowes of his Paſſions, as they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109869:14"/> look to be Fellows of his Glory; that ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with him and by his Example, they may apply unto themſelves and to others, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Medicine of <hi>Chriſts merits</hi> and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it is alſo effectually applyed unto us by Sacraments; the one ſort being no more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto <hi>Chriſts death,</hi> nor conſequently hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him of the whole Glory of the work of mans Salvation, then the other; notwithſtanding your vain clamours, that would upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Chriſt paſſions</hi> take away the Value of <hi>good Works:</hi> if you pleaſe to peruſe St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> (c. 1. v. 24.) you may ſee how the Apoſtle taught and practiſed this Doctrine. Neither do I ſee, what pretence you can have, to affirm, that the Merit of <hi>good Works,</hi> hindreth God of the whole Glory of the Work of mans Salvation, ſeeing the ſaid Merit is a pure <hi>Gift of God,</hi> and no leſs his than his own; for not only thoſe paſſions, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered in himſelf, which were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended at his death, and were in themſelves abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> for the Redemption of the World, and of all ſins; but alſo thoſe, which his body and members ſuffer, are <hi>Chriſts</hi> alſo, becauſe of him they receive the Condition, Quality, and Force to be meritorious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactory.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond <hi>Query</hi> is this, <hi>Whether Chriſt deſerve to have the whole Glory of mediating and interceding for Sinners?</hi> To which I anſwer alſo <hi>Affirmatively;</hi> but withal deny the ſiniſtrous Conſequence which you hence infer, <hi>Therefore we muſt not pray to Saints;</hi> for it doth no more derogate from <hi>Chriſts</hi> whole Glory of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for ſinners, to pray unto Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109869:15"/> then to pray unto the <hi>Faithful</hi> upon Earth, (if it do, I pray you ſhew me the Diſparity) and yet our Prayers unto the Faithful upon Earth, doth not at all derogate from <hi>Chriſts</hi> whole Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Witneſs the Practiſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in this very point to the <hi>Romans Epiſt. ad. Rom.</hi> c. 15. I <hi>beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you ſtrive together with me in your Prayers to God for Me,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe be the words of your own Tranſlation, in the year, 1662.</p>
               <p>Your third and laſt <hi>Query</hi> is this, <hi>Whether it be the ſafeſt way for man, to caſt himſelf down to the loweſt duſt of Humility before the Footſtool of God, and to acknowledge his own worthleſneſs, and unworthineſs?</hi> To which I Anſwer <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> as above; and am now in great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſee you improve theſe three <hi>Queries</hi> to be powerful Engines, to batter down the greateſt part of the Fabrick of our Religion.</p>
               <p>But before you do embroyl your ſelf in this new Engagement, of demoliſhing the Fabrick of our Religion, I muſt make bold to entreat theſe following Favours of you, which in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you are bound to perform.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that you would ſhew me any one of the foreſaid Points, evidenced out of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> works; mark I beſeech you, your own word <hi>evidenced,</hi> not wreſted by your own ſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Interpretation; cite faithfully the <hi>Saints Words,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Place,</hi> where they are to be found: pick and chuſe which of the foreſaid Points you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that you would ſhew me any one <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> included in the Traditions of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109869:15"/> 
                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> rejected by the <hi>Britains,</hi> in which the <hi>Britains</hi> diſſented from St <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that you would ſhew me a ſubſtantial Proof, which may convince a <hi>non-prejudging</hi> Underſtanding, affirming that the foreſaid <hi>Monkes were not ſlain by Edilfred</hi> the Heathen King of <hi>Northumbers,</hi> but <hi>by Ethelbert</hi> the Chriſtian King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>by the inſtigation of St</hi> Auſtin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, as you peremptorily affirm.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that you would <hi>ſtick to the thing you undertake to prove,</hi> until ſuch time as you have ſufficiently proved it, without diverting to any other point.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that you would be pleaſed to <hi>deſiſt from wilfully miſinterpreting my Words,</hi> quite contrary to the ſenſe they were ſpoken in; diverting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Reader, from the true ſtate of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as you did in your <hi>anſwer to my note,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more Connection between my Words and my meaning, then there is coherence in, which is my way to London, a <hi>poak full of Plumbs.</hi> I do not queſtion, but this uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of proceeding, may eaſily induce the <hi>illitterate Rabble,</hi> which have ſcarce wit to diſtinguiſh right from left, to paſs a raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon your Adverſary; but withal will be ſufficient witneſs to a <hi>Learned Jury,</hi> to make them bring in their <hi>verdict</hi> againſt you, according to your deſert. I confeſs this pittiful ſhift, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords you a ſtarting hole to your <hi>impertinent Erudition,</hi> verbal Flouriſhes, rhetorical Excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch like <hi>impertinence;</hi> but when you have talked your ſelf weary, the reſult is <hi>vox &amp; preterea nihil;</hi> you have onely catched ſhadows, and <hi>aerem verlerans</hi> whipt your ſelf more than your Adverſary, as incurring hereby
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109869:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> the juſt Cenſure of <hi>unhandſome dealing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, Seeing the diſpute betwixt me and you, is not as it is among <hi>Butter-women</hi> at the Market-Croſs, that either you or I may have the upper hand therein; but that <hi>Naked-Truth</hi> may have place: I muſt make bold to beg one favour more, that you would be pleaſed to <hi>abſtain from ſuch reviling and exaſperating language,</hi> fit rather to be ſpoken in the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> than by one of your calling, as you unadviſedly vented in <hi>your anſwer to my note;</hi> for <hi>in troubled waters truth can never be diſcerned,</hi> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Chapter the Eleventh, <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch custome, nor the Church of God.</hi>

               <p>HAd not Divine Providence (as you ſay it dealt with you) appointed me to a great Indiſpoſition of body, you had long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to your Reply: and now it comes into the World as <hi>Ichabod</hi> did, being the <hi>Iſſue of an haſty Travail;</hi> though I have not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the date you uſed in replying (which in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould have been granted) yet ſome <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> that <hi>defie the Truths of the everliving God,</hi> begin to triumph, as if my pen was ſtruck dumb by yours.</p>
               <p>To ſilence theſe, that it may <hi>not be told in Gath,</hi> nor <hi>Publiſhed in the ſtreets of Askalon,</hi> that there is any weakneſs in the Cauſe maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or difficulty in the Work to be done by me, it anticipates my recovery, and comes forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109869:16"/> my health affords me the liberty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, of taking that ſerious view of your Reply, and of the Authors to whom you ſend me, which I deſired to beſtow vpon them.</p>
               <p>By that haſty Peruſal I have made, I find your Reply ſpeaking this Truth, <hi>ſpes eſt rei incertae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> it is ſo far from being ſatisfactory to me (as you hoped) that it hath mightily confirmed me in my judgment, againſt the Cauſe maintained by you, and made me to fall ſomewhat, in my good Opinion of your Perſon; giving me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to think, that you are a man that will do and ſpeak any thing, for the advancing of your own Intereſt; becauſe you bring many heavy Charges againſt me, for which you have no more reaſon, than the man had for his Conceit, who thought his Body to be made of glaſſe, which was only the working of his <hi>diſturbed Brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You accuſe me of <hi>Impertinency;</hi> but this is very impertinently done by you, becauſe you have not ſhewed, how and wherein my anſwer hath run beyond the limits of your <hi>Queries.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. You inveigh againſt our common People, terming them an <hi>illiterate Rabble,</hi> detained by us in Ignorance, on purpoſe to keep them poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a Prejudice againſt your <hi>Religion;</hi> but of all the men in the world, you have leaſt

               <p>SHould I tell you, that you are fallen out with your <hi>brief Note,</hi> you would ſay that I lie in Ambuſh to catch at your words, by willfully miſtaking your meaning; what mean you then by entituling your three <hi>Queries</hi> now, ſo as to make them all but one Queſtion, the queſtion (ſay you) propounded was this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is reaſon to ſuſpect ſome deſign in it; but I matter not what it is, becauſe I do not fear any diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to fall unto the <hi>Truth</hi> by it: but <hi>I</hi> would have the Reader to conſider, how much Credit is to be yeilded to your words, being that you are thus <hi>contradictory</hi> to your ſelf; if it be not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, pray reſolve me, how three diſtinct <hi>Queries</hi> can be but one Queſtion, and that one Queſtion entituled <hi>a breif Note concerning Points of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here in the beginning of your Reply, <hi>I</hi> find the old proverb to be verified, <hi>Claudius ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſat Maechum;</hi> you are guilty of that, for which you have accuſed and condemned me. Here are verbal Flouriſhes and rhetorical Excurſions, charging me highly of many miſdemeanors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in my Anſwer, and promiſing great things for your ſelf, how exact and pertinent you will be in your following Reply; to diſpel (as a light vapour) all that is material in my Anſwer. Thus while by fair flouriſhes you raiſe a miſt before the eyes of your Reader, you lurk away without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of a great part of my Anſwer upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109869:18"/> the pretended ground of <hi>Impertinency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tell me ſeriouſly, is it <hi>Impertinent</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the nature of your <hi>Queries? I</hi> told you, that the Determination of them on either ſide was unneceſſary: Firſt for the common People; this <hi>I</hi> put you in mind of, in the begining of my Anſwer, therefore <hi>I</hi> deſired to hear of ſome reaſon, why you would ſend out ſuch <hi>Queries;</hi> you who pretend ſo much unto Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, charging my Anſwer as ineffectual in relation to this end, ſhould have given ſome Reaſon for this, to ſhield your ſelf from the imputation of loading their heads with unneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Poſitions, and puzling their braines with ſuch like <hi>Queries;</hi> you ſhould have proved the Determination of them to be edificative, which being not done, your talking of Edification may be deſervedly interpreted meer <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Unneceſſary for your Self, as to the effecting of that end you looked at, in propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your <hi>Queries;</hi> wherefore <hi>I</hi> demanded earneſtly to know, why you would have theſe three Queries diſputed, while the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one (namely whither your Religion be the ſame, that was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles) would bring us ſooner to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth: <hi>I</hi> will tell you once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that if you have no better Arguments, to prove your Religion to be true, then ſuch as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> may uſe for the proof of their Religion, ſuch as Antiquity and Succeſſion; for all your great braggs, yours may be (as theirs is) <hi>The meer invention of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But neceſſary or not, you muſt have your <hi>Queries</hi> determined, or elſe the Truth, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to belong unto your Religion, falls unto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109869:18"/> the Ground; what is the Reaſon of this impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Longing? Sure, it is ſome great Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which you know to be in your Religion, for which you diſtruſt it, as not able to endure the Tryal of the infallible Rule.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>I</hi> find you very ſcarce of Arguments, to prove your Religion to be true, being that you are ſo earneſt, to have that which is neceſſary to be known, proved by that Knowledge which is unneceſſary; whether your Religion be true or falſe, is neceſſary to be known; but whether <hi>Auſtin</hi> was of your Religion, or the antient <hi>Brittains</hi> was of his; or whether the Religion of the antient <hi>Brittains,</hi> was the ſame with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Religion, is not neceſſary to be known. There are many precious Souls gone to Heaven, that never heard of you, nor <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor the antient <hi>Brittains;</hi> and yet this is the grand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod you uſe, and hence you would draw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, to prove the Truth you claim for your Religion.</p>
               <p>Well, becauſe you dote upon this Argument (as much as the <hi>Ape</hi> doth upon her Iſſue, though never ſo deformed) I am content, you ſhould uſe the Strength of it againſt me, and let us ſee how advantagious the Management of it will prove for you. Thus you argue, that Religion which <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſed is true; but the Religion now profeſſed by the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> is the ſame that <hi>Auſtin</hi> profeſſed, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> being one of the things in queſtion, ſhall not be ſpoken to now; how you do prove it, will be examined in its proper place. The Juncture of your <hi>Queries</hi> tells me, that you muſt prove your <hi>Major</hi> thus; that the Religion, which the antient <hi>Brittains</hi> profeſſed in <hi>Auſtins</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:109869:19"/> time, is true; but the Religion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is the ſame which the antient <hi>Brittains</hi> in his time profeſſed, <hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c. your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> likewiſe being another thing in queſtion, ſhall be paſſed by until another Opportunity; it is your <hi>Major</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſeem that you are not the man I took you to be; are you not a <hi>Roman Catholick?</hi> This is a Title you aſſume unto your ſelf, though there be a Contradiction in the termes; and will you forſake your Colours, and fight under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Banner? Have you not forſaken the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which ſometime you ſay is the <hi>infallible</hi> Guide? And do you not fly unto the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed <hi>Brittains</hi> for help? You muſt confeſs your ſelf to be guilty of this Practiſe, or elſe you muſt throw away your Argument. <hi>I</hi> hope you are not ignorant of this, that the <hi>Medium</hi> uſed for a proof, muſt be more evident than the <hi>Thing</hi> proved; you muſt confeſs then, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion profeſſed by the <hi>Brittains,</hi> was more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, then that profeſſed by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or that of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church; otherwiſe why do you draw an Argument thence, to prove <hi>Auſtins</hi> Religion to be true? and why an Argument thence, rather than from the Religion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church? Pray Sir, let me know, whether you claim a Succeſſion in Religion from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Brittains,</hi> as well as you are beholding to them for this Argument? It ſeems to me, that you do acknowledg this Claim; were <hi>I</hi> aſſured of it, I could make excellent uſe of it againſt you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition you prove thus; The Religion brought into <hi>England</hi> by its firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertors (it being that which was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles) is true; but the Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the antient <hi>Brittans,</hi> is the ſame that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109869:19"/> was brought into <hi>England</hi> by its firſt Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Aſſumption I</hi> likewiſe paſs by, until another time of Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is an undeniable Truth; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion firſt brought into <hi>England,</hi> the Religion taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles is true, here we do reſt our ſelves, upon this Rock do we build, and hither by the conduct of your <hi>queries</hi> do you fly; why did you not uſe this <hi>medium</hi> at firſt, to prevent the unneceſſary Travel that you have made? is it not a far more eaſy work to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether your Religion be the ſame, that was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles; than to examine whither yours be the ſame with <hi>Auſtins, Auſtins</hi> the ſame with that of the antient <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> the ancient <hi>Brittains</hi> the ſame with that taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles? Let us then leave <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the antient <hi>Brittains,</hi> to ſtand or fall to their own Maſter, and let us diſpute this Queſtion fairly, whether your Religion be the ſame that was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles? and if you can convince me of the Truth of the Affirmative, by proving your Religion to be conformable unto the infallible Rule, (where we are to inquire for the Religion taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles) <hi>I</hi> will be of your Religion; until that be done, <hi>I</hi> am obliged, by that little knowledge which <hi>I</hi> have, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
               <p>Having put you in mind of that part of my Anſwer, with which you were pleaſed to deal, as the <hi>Levite</hi> dealt with the wounded man, only looking upon it, and paſſing it by, I come now to examine the matter of your Reply.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay the Reaſon why you did</hi> demand <hi>and not</hi>

               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>You ſend me for a Proof of your <hi>Affirmative,</hi> unto the Author of the Book called the <hi>Three Converſions of England,</hi> and to the Author of that called <hi>The Proteſtants Apology for the Roman Church:</hi> Surely, this is a compendious way of proving, and very cheap too, coſting very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle paines; and do you think that it is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enough to prove your Affirmative? becauſe you have ſent it to me, as an argument endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that great ability, you are bound by the Law of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> to accept of the like proof from me, as ſubſtantial enough to prove my <hi>Negative;</hi> be pleaſed then to peruſe that learned Treatiſe, called the <hi>Proteſtants Appeal</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Moorton,</hi> where you will find your <hi>Apology for the Roman Church</hi> ſubſtantially confuted, together with Arguments, taken from your own learned Writers, to confirm my <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi> Peruſe likewiſe that Treatiſe, called, <hi>The Subverſion of the three Converſions</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Sutcliffe;</hi> and you will finde Arguments there for the ſame purpoſe. Thus you teach me to argue by your Example, being that my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is as like unto yours, as one Egg is unto another, there is great reaſon, that you ſhould ſuffer it to have as powerful working upon your ſelf, as you expect yours ſhould have upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109869:20"/> me: So there is no need, that I ſhould ſtand to refute your <hi>Affirmative,</hi> or to confirm my <hi>Negative,</hi> the work being done already to my hands.</p>
               <p>But what mean you by foreſaid Queſtion, for the Proof of the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of which (you ſay) you have the Teſtimony of many learned Proteſtants? if you mean one of the three <hi>Queries</hi> ſingly, then which of them is it? The firſt or ſecond, or third? you ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed which it is, then had you played your Game above-board; it may be that you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Proteſtant Writers, aſſerting the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of ſome one of them; if you would therefore perſwade your Reader, to believe that there are Proteſtant Writers, that do grant the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of all; this is real <hi>Juggling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by foreſaid Queſtion, you mean all the three <hi>Queries; I</hi> wonder that you are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to vent ſuch an Expreſſion; can you perſwade any one to believe, that a Proteſtant (while he is a Proteſtant) will maintain the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of all the three <hi>Queries?</hi> that your Religion is the ſame with <hi>Auſtins,</hi> his the ſame with the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> theirs the ſame with that firſt brought into <hi>England;</hi> is not this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſay, that your Religion is the ſame that was taught by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles? and will any Proteſtant ſay this? is not this <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to renounce the Proteſtants as falſe, and to acknowledge yours to be true? and will or can any Proteſtant (while he is a Proteſtant) do ſo? ſurely that Religion hath but a weak Foundation, that needs to be ſupported with ſuch Stories as theſe.</p>

               <p>I leave it now to the Judicious Reader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether you have performed that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize (which you account ſo eaſy,) of proving the <hi>Affirmative</hi> of your <hi>Queries</hi> with ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Arguments, ſuch as may be convincing to the <hi>Non-prejudging</hi> Underſtanding; truly this cannot be done by ſending me to Authors, who produce ſome Teſtimonies, ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your purpoſe, and who uſe ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as lame in their Propoſitions, as the Cauſe is, which they endeavour to ſtrengthen; if I do wrong your Authors by this imputation, I hope you will vindicate them, by diſplaying their arguments to be viewed in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now give judgment uprightly, ſpeaking, as you are obliged, by convincing Reaſon (once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the groundleſs affection you bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your own <hi>Cauſe</hi>) and tell me whether the Doctrine of <hi>Gregory</hi> in theſe particulars, be the ſame with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> the matter is ſo plain, that unleſs you wilfully ſhut your eyes againſt the light, you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it; go then and divide between Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and his Legat <hi>Auſtin,</hi> by ſaying that they were different in Religion, or elſe confeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, that your Religion is not the ſame, that was brought by <hi>Auſtin</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all your great brags of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> the Religion now profeſſed by you, wants ſo much of the date of <hi>Auſtins,</hi> that it is no older than the Counſel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and to make good what I ſay, I ſhall lay down theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſitions.</p>
               <p>The firſt is made by <hi>Veroon</hi> (one of your great Champions) muſtering all his Forces for the maintenance of your Religion; he tells you in his <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> that <hi>that Doctrine is an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:109869:24"/> of faith, which hath Divine Revelation, and the Churches Propoſition, either by her general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> or <hi>by the definition of a general Councel;</hi> Theſe two Requiſites he makes the formal cauſe of an Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, the <hi>Additions of Doctrines for Articles of Faith,</hi> which were not Articles of Faith before, unto the Religion formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, doth alter Religion really from what it was. Articles of Faith are the eſſential parts of Religion, and the addition of more Eſſentials to a compound, alters the Compound: What is it which changeth Religion from its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſtitution? it muſt be either <hi>Additions</hi> or <hi>Subſtractions,</hi> either of which being made, the neceſſary Reſult is, a <hi>real Change in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is this, by the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent <hi>there were many Doctrines propounded and defined to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Articles of Faith, which were not Articles of Fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> before;</hi> which is proved, becauſe they were not propounded for ſuch by the Church, either by her general Practiſe, or by the definition of a general Council: that they were not generally practiſed for ſuch before is clear enough; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were defined to be ſuch by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Trent.</hi> For the Definition of a general Councel is to correct the want of general Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, otherwiſe that definition is unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If a Doctrine be received by the univerſal Church for an Article of Faith, what need is there of a general Council to define it to be an Article of Faith? And that they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined before, is as clear; for if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined before, where was the Infallibility of your Head the <hi>Pope?</hi> Was it not an Errour in him
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109869:24"/> to ſummon a Council, to perform an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work, to do that which was done before? and if they were defined before, ſhew me to what Council or Councils, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> agrees in all its Definitions: From all this it neceſſarily follows, that the body of Religion, compacted by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is not the ſame that was profeſſed before.</p>
               <p>Whether this Diſcourſe be rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, <hi>I</hi> ſubmit to the determination of better Judgments; and how you will avoid the force of it, <hi>I</hi> deſire to know; for <hi>I</hi> profeſs my ſelf to be a Learner, and would fain be undeceived in any Opinion maintained by me, that can be proved to be contrary to the Truth: You cry out upon us to ſhew, where our Religion was before <hi>Luther,</hi> as if it was a Child of his begetting, and never ſaw the light before he brought it into the world: But we have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon to call upon you, and demand where your Religion was before the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> untill <hi>I</hi> be convinced by ſtronger Arguments, than <hi>I</hi> have found yet in any of your Writers; <hi>I</hi> will maintain this to be a Truth, that the Religion profeſſed by you, looks no farther towards An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, than unto the late little Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, you reply unto the Anſwer made unto the ſecond <hi>Query;</hi> and here (<hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) you conceit your main ſtrength to lye; becauſe you have taken ſuch pains in penning a long Diſcourſe, charging me with a vain and malicious Inference, together with two groſſe and ſhameful Miſtakes: And indeed if the Charge was deſerved, there would be ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of boaſting for you; but when <hi>I</hi> have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109869:25"/> in my own Defence, <hi>I</hi> ſhall deſire the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to determine, at whoſe door the groſſe miſtakes deſerve moſt to be laid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at mine or yours?</p>
               <p>The vain and malicious Inference, with which you charge me is, for concluding from the words of <hi>Galfridus Monumetenſis,</hi> that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Brittains would have nothing to do with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome;</hi> but if you were required to prove, that <hi>I</hi> made this Inference from his words, you would find but a feeble Argument for it, unleſs you can prove, that you know every thing that is done by me, or that there is no other Authour that ſpeaketh to my purpoſe: But let this paſs, and let us reaſon a little concerning the force of his words, in what they may freely intimate unto us, without any ſtreſs laid upon them; and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but to make it plain to your own underſtanding, that you had no reaſon to ſay, that the deduction made from his words is vain and malicious.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>You ſay, he reports the <hi>Brittains returning this Anſwer unto</hi> Auſtin (<hi>when he required ſubjection from them) That they owed no ſubjection unto him, becauſe they had an</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>of their own, to whom they were to ſubject themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>Let me ask you, whether <hi>Auſtin</hi> had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to require Subjection from them or not? if you ſay, he had not, you make him a ſtrange kind of <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> while he ſhould have been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in employing his utmoſt endeavours for the Converſion of <hi>Pagans,</hi> you report him to be exerciſing of Pride and Ambition, in requiring ſubjection from them, from whom he was not authoriſed to require any ſuch thing.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109869:25"/>
               <p>If you ſay that he had a Commiſſion, and did not ſhew it; (as indeed there is ſomewhat in your words to this purpoſe, you ſay that you do not read, that he ſhewed any Commiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,) but this is but a weak Argument to prove that he did not ſhew it) then you make him guilty of Indiſcretion and Uncharitableneſs in his carriage towards the <hi>Brittaines.</hi> Think you that it was any part of Diſcretion and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to conceal that which would have ſheilded him, from the Imputation of Pride and Ambition, and would have helped to compoſe the difference between them; if the <hi>Brittains</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that to be true, which you ſay is a Maxime, to wit, <hi>that every Chriſtian ſhould be ſubject to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome?</p>
               <p>Now chooſe whether you will brand your Apoſtle of <hi>England</hi> (as you ſtile him) with Pride and Ambition, by ſaying he had no Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or with Indiſcretion and Uncharitableneſs, by ſaying he did not ſhew it? or will grant, that he did ſhew it? I ſuppoſe this laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will be the object of your Choice, rather than you will acknowledge him to be guilty of ſo great failing as is mentioned, in managing the Truſt committed unto him by his Maſter; and tell me whether it be a vain and malicious Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to conclude from the words of <hi>Galfridus Monumetenſis,</hi> that the <hi>Brittains</hi> returned this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>they would have nothing to to do with the Biſhop of</hi> Rome; if they denyed to yeild Subjection unto <hi>Auſtin,</hi> authorized by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and knowing him to be authorized to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Subjection from them; this is not only to reject <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but alſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have nothing to do with them both.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:109869:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But yet <hi>I</hi> have not done with you as to this matter: You ſay, that for any thing the <hi>Brittains</hi> did know, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſent only to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> ſure you would have the <hi>Brittain</hi>-Biſhops to be meer Ideots: Did they not know that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſubjection from them? And do you think that they would not (as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> demanded of our Saviour) enquire of him, <hi>by what authority he did thoſe things,</hi> and <hi>who gave him that Authority?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beda</hi> tells us, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> gave him authority to require Subjection from them; <hi>Bed. Hiſt. l. 1. c.</hi> 27. And no doubt, had they not known this, that he was ſent to them, by one grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf for this end; they would not have ſpent time in diſputing Juriſdictions with him; but ſoon have told him, that he was a proud and pragmattical Fellow, for attempting to domineer over all, and to ſubject all unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon his firſt footing in <hi>England:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they diſpute Juriſdictions with him, it was (without queſtion) in relation to Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and their own Archbiſhop, and ſo their anſwer was not (as you ſay) <hi>as of men inflamed with Choller for the Injury done by the</hi> Saxons; (and pray conſider, what juſtice would have been acted, in being angry with one man for another mans fault) but as of men preferring their own Archbiſhop, before Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> aſſerting no dependance upon, and owing no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto him; but owning their own Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop as his Superiour in relation unto them: wherefore, <hi>I</hi> ſay, if <hi>I</hi> had no other Teſtimony to produce, but that of <hi>Galfrides Monumetenſis,</hi> it is ſufficient to diſcharge me from the guilt of a vain and malicious Inference, and to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109869:26"/> prove, that the antient <hi>Britains</hi> told <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that <hi>they would have nothing to do with the Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> have other Teſtimonies to produce; be pleaſed to ſearch <hi>Antiqui.

They ſaid they would not be ſubject to any forraign Biſhop; Is not this to ſay that they would not be ſubject to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſure he was a <hi>forreign Biſhop?</hi> your own <hi>Baronius</hi> terms the <hi>Brittain</hi>-Biſhops <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> for this very reaſon, becauſe they divided from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo did not yield ſubjection unto the <hi>Pope.

               <p>To the ſecond Reaſon which <hi>I</hi> uſed to prove, that the Religion of the antient <hi>Brittains,</hi> was not the ſame with <hi>Auſtins,</hi> which was this, becauſe they rejected <hi>Auſtins</hi> Traditions, you reply thus.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You Believe the Reaſon, why I did not ſet down in particular the Traditions rejected by the</hi> Brittains, <hi>was, becauſe I could not ſhew any one Article of Faith (which unleſs I do, my objection is nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) in which they diſſented from</hi> Auſtin.</p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>I perceive you are very credulous, eſpecially where the matter to be believed, hath any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to your advantage; otherwiſe you would not believe this concluſion to be true, <hi>that thing is impoſſible to be done, which is not actually done;</hi> but whatſoever this work, of ſhewing Articles of Faith wherein they differed, be poſſible or impoſſible, it was not ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> (as you ſay it was) for me to do it; a general
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109869:27"/> Proof being ſufficient to confirm what I ſaid; and (I am ſure) as ſtrong as any Argument uſed by you to prove the contrary; if you had weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your own Performance in the ballance, you would have found Reaſon forbidding you, to object this againſt me; leaſt you ſhould teach me to retort and ſay, That <hi>I</hi> believe the reaſon why you did not ſhew me any one Article of Faith wherein they agreed, was becauſe you could not; for neither you nor your Author to whom you ſent me, hath done any thing like unto this work, and yet this ſhould have been done by you: yea, if you would have proved your <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> with an argument any thing like unto ſubſtantial, you ſhould have proved in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that they agreed in all the Articles of their Faith.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that it is as poſſible for me, to ſhew ſome Article of Faith wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as it is for you to ſhew Articles of Faith wherein they agreed; Hiſtories being equally ſilent in both: Only it muſt be neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that, becauſe they were all Chriſtians, they agreed in ſome Principles of Chriſtianity: and on the contrary, becauſe they were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Chriſtians, why might it not be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumed, that they diſſented in others? and why might not my Argument, be able to prove this preſumption? but you have rejected it as weak (though, as will appear, you have no reaſon for it) by which you have obliged your ſelf to produce a ſtronger on your ſide; and whether yours be ſuch, I come now to Examine.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>To prove that they did not differ in any one Article of Faith, firſt you ſay, <hi>all the Difference
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109869:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> that was between them, was only concerning certain tollerable Differences for that time, as namely their Diſſent from the uſe of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, in their miniſtring of</hi> Baptiſm <hi>and keeping of</hi> Eaſter,</p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>Was this all the difference that was between them? did you not tell me even now, that they differed in Point of Juriſdiction? you charge me with groſs miſtakes; let me deſire you to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile your expreſſions, to free your ſelf from the charge of Contradiction; for if you do not here contradict, what you ſaid before, I know not what I ſay.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>That this was all the difference that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; you bring <hi>Beda</hi> to teſtify ſaying, <hi>ſi in his tribus obtemper are mihi vultis, &amp; tum</hi> Brito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>confitentur ſe intellexiſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>Do not you by your Aſſertion contradict this Teſtimony? what is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>caetera quae agitis, quamvis moribus noſtris contraria aequanimiter cuncta tollerabimus;</hi> if <hi>Beda's</hi> relation be true, and I do underſtand the Latin he writes, they differed in many particulars, beſides thoſe mentioned by you: and what is implyed in his other words (<hi>tum</hi> Britones <hi>confitentur ſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellexiſſe</hi> &amp;c.) it ſhould ſeem that they differed about the way of Juſtice; otherwiſe how could <hi>Beda</hi> uſe this expreſſion? and to differ (as you ſay) about things that are <hi>tollerable,</hi> is this to differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the way of Juſtice? I hope you will not ſay, that the obſervation of unneceſſary Teſtimonies, is the way of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Hiſtory of great</hi> Britain, whom you produce for a Teſtimony on your ſide
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109869:28"/> (as you quote him) ſpeaks not for you, but againſt you; he ſays the <hi>Brittain-Biſhops conformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>without any difference in any thing ſpecially remembred, ſave only in the Feaſt of</hi> Eaſter, and <hi>Adminiſtration of the Sacrament of</hi> Baptiſme; what means this limitation of <hi>ſpecial remembrance?</hi> doth it not ſtrongly import, that there were other differences between them, that were not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and ſpecially remembred; that is (as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> is to be underſtood) fell not into open Debate between them at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hollinſheads</hi> Words you have not mentioned, therefore all that I ſay to him is this, that if he ſpeak no more on your ſide, then <hi>Beda</hi> or the Author of the <hi>Hiſtory of Great</hi> Brittain, you have as little reaſon to quote him, as you had to quote them, that is none at all.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Goodwin</hi> in his <hi>Catalogue of Biſhops; I</hi> have ſearched his ſixth page, whither you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me, and do find there, no ſuch thing as you ſpeak of; but in the 43. <hi>Page</hi> you will find him ſpeaking directly againſt you. And becauſe you have quoted him as a Witneſs for your ſelf, his Teſtimony ſhould be of good account with you; his words are theſe, <hi>but their Anſwer to him was ſhort and peremptory, that they might not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, having an Arch-Biſhop of their own. That the Doctrine and Diſcipline of their Church, they had received from the Apoſtles of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they change the ſame, for any mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas you ſay, that <hi>Mr. Fulke</hi> affirms, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did at the laſt obtain the Aid of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops to the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> if you think this to be a Teſtimony on your ſide,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109869:28"/> you are very much miſtaken; for the words do but prove expreſly, that they agreed to work together for the Converſion of <hi>Pagans,</hi> which Conſent was not any hinderance, but there might be differences, and great ones too, between them concerning other matters; but if you ſhould ſtrain the words to make them imply, that there was not any difference between them, when they joyned together to carry on that good work, yet this was not any impediment to hinder differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between them before.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> you ſay; <hi>That by their earneſt diſſenting about theſe only ſmaller matters, is moſt plainly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their full agreement in all Articles of Faith; for the</hi> Brittains <hi>that contradicted him in theſe ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler matters, would not have been ſilent, but much more have oppoſed him in matters of greater Concernment.</hi>

               <p>You go on ſtill upon that ground, which you have not yet proved to be true, nay, ſome of the Teſtimonies produced by you, have proved it to be falſe; namely, that they diſſented only about thoſe matters of ſmaller Importance, and that the <hi>Brittains</hi> oppoſed him only in thoſe matters. <hi>I</hi> tell you once again from your Author <hi>Beda,</hi> that they differed in many more and greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; ſearch the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond Book of <hi>Beda,</hi> and you will find him reporting, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> told them, <hi>that they did many things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Practiſe of the Catholick Church, and that he prayed unto God, that by a Miracle he would be pleaſed to ſhew, which was the true way unto the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> it ſeemed they differed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this way, otherwiſe why would he make this Prayer? And he tells you in the latter end,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109869:29"/> that they oppoſed him in all that he ſaid, and ſure he ſaid ſomewhat more unto them, than what concerned thoſe tollerable Differences you ſpeak of; otherwiſe how could <hi>Beda,</hi> with any ſhew of Truth, conclude his ſecond Chapter thus, <hi>ut eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am temporalis interitus ultionem ſentirent perfidi, quod oblata ſibi perpetuae ſalutis concilia ſpreverant,</hi> were your tollerable Differences the <hi>Councils of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument you borrowed of your <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt,</hi> and he borrowed it from the Author of <hi>the three Converſions;</hi> and if by earneſt diſſenting, you mean an open Debating and Diſputing, where it is as true as it is falſe, that they diſſented only about thoſe ſmaller matters; <hi>I</hi> wonder that you and your Authors ſhould expoſe ſuch a tottering Argument as this to the view of the Reader, without ſupporting it with ſome Reaſon, to keep it from falling to the ground. It is as if you ſhould reaſon concerning <hi>Michaiah</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> (of whom you may read in the 18 <hi>ch.</hi> of the 2 Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi>) and ſay they openly diſſented only concerning the event of <hi>Ahabs</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> therefore they agreed in all weightier matters; for <hi>Michaiah</hi> that oppoſed <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah</hi> in this ſmaller matter of Importance, would never have been ſilent, but much more have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him in a greater matter; but this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude both againſt Reaſon and Experience; for the one was a true Prophet, and ſervant to the God of Heaven, the other a falſe Prophet &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of <hi>Baal.</hi> You and I were in open &amp; actual Debate, concerning only the Determination of the three <hi>Queries</hi> propounded by you, which (in my judgment) is a matter of ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. I aſſure you the Determination of them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109869:29"/> on either ſide, is not any Article of my Faith; and if it be an Article of yours, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay, that your Creed is larger than that ſet forth by <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth; and yet this open and actual Debate, is no ſufficient Argument to prove, that you and <hi>I</hi> do agree concerning all greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for you know that we do not.</p>
               <p>Having ſet forth your Argument to be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its ſtrength, the Reader may judg now, whether yours or mine hath more in it, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Concluſion: notwithſtanding all that you have yet ſaid, it may be juſtly determined, that my Argument taken from the rejection of <hi>Auſtins</hi> Traditions (which you have ſo much ſcorned) is of ſo great force, that the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance you have made againſt it, is only to ſay, that it was uſed to no purpoſe; for this you have not yet proved; and to let you ſee more of the ſtrength of it, <hi>I</hi> ſhall add this; if the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were received by the <hi>Brittains,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern only the <hi>tollerable Differences</hi> you ſpeak of; was it piouſly and charitably done of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to threaten them for this Rejection? And could he juſtly prophecy of their Ruine for it? Did the rejecting of thoſe ſmall matters, deſerve ſo great Revenge at the hands of the Almighty? You muſt caſt an everlaſting blot in the face of the <hi>Italian Monk,</hi> or elſe you muſt acknowledge that they oppoſed him in greater matters; for which (you muſt ſay) they deſerved to be thus retributed: and farther I ſay, if <hi>Auſtins</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agreed to the Doctrine of thoſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops, which were in the time of <hi>Laurentius (Auſtins</hi> immediate Succeſſor) they were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtful, that Biſhop <hi>Dagamus</hi> denied all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the maintainers of them, and refuſed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109869:30"/> to eat Bread in the ſame Inn where they did Lodg. <hi>Bed.

               <p>And now I cannot but take notice of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Limitation which you do apply unto your <hi>tollerable Differences,</hi> you ſay for that time tollerable; will you be pleaſed to tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe differences, if happening before, or at any time ſince, muſt have the contrary Epithite given unto them, and be ſaid to be <hi>intollerable?</hi> Can matters of <hi>Indifferency</hi> by revolution of time change their Natures &amp; become matters of <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> Can Circumſtances be made Articles of Faith? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fruitful in bringing forth ſuch and more ſtrange Mutations; but they who prize that benefit of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, will not by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch Change, bring themſelves again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bondage: It is true, the command of the Church, doth oblige unto the obſervance of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, tending to <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> but ſhe doth not enjoyn the uſe of them, otherwiſe than they are, that is, not as neceſſary, but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;</hi> and bears with tender Conſciences that ſcruple to uſe them, untill better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth remove the Scruple, and convinceth them of the Conveniency there is, that they ſhould be uſed.</p>

               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It happened, that the mighty King of the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Edilfred <hi>gathered a great Army, and made a foul ſlaughter of this unfaithful and naughty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to wit, the Monks of</hi> Bangor; <hi>for being now ready to give the onſet of the Fight, when he eſpied the Priests (which came together to pray unto</hi> God <hi>for their Souldiers Warring) stand a part from the rest in a ſafe and ſure place, he demanded who they were, and to what end they came thither,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the cauſe of their coming thither when King</hi> Edilfred <hi>had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, he ſaid, if theſe men cry and call upon their</hi> God <hi>against us, truly though they have no Armour, yet they fight against us, therefore he commanded his Souldiers first to aſſault them.</hi> Beda. l. 2. c. 2.</p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>Your Author ſpeaks very contemptibly of the Monkes of <hi>Bangor,</hi> terming them an <hi>unfaithful and naughty People;</hi> therefore if you think that he ſpeaks Truth, it is ſtrange to me, that you are ſo earneſt in claiming kindred with their Religion; and from his words you conclude, that the Cauſe of their ſlaughter, was not the rejection of <hi>Austins</hi> Traditions, but their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to pray for the good ſucceſs of their Army, and that it was not <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> but <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northumbres</hi> that made this ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>While you are accuſing me of a groſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, you attract the ſame guilt unto your ſelf, by forcing your Witneſs to ſpeak what he never intended, and by which you make him to contradict himſelf; he ſaies (as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) that <hi>the Monks were ſlain for coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109869:31"/> to pray for the good ſucceſs of their Army;</hi> ſuppoſe he doth ſay ſo, doth he mean that this was the only Cauſe? no, he cannot mean ſo; for you confeſs in the next Paragraph, that he he tells of another Cauſe, to wit, <hi>their Refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe in not ſubmitting to the wholſome Council of</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and refuſing to Joyn with him in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Engliſh;</hi> by which the Propheſy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be made by <hi>Austin</hi> was fulfilled: <hi>Beda</hi> reportes him, and (I believe) you accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And how will you keep his words from claſhing, if you will have him to ſay, that the only cauſe was <hi>their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray for the ſucceſs of their Army?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Teſtimony of your own Witneſs, ſhould be a full ſatisfaction unto you, his words are ſo plain to prove, that there was another Cauſe of their Slaughter, beſides that mentioned by you; but leaſt you ſhould not ſuffer his words to have this Influence over you, I ſhall prove by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Reaſon that there was another Cauſe. You will acknowledg that there was a cauſe of <hi>Edilfreds</hi> gathering together of an Army, and of his marching againſt the <hi>Brittains;</hi> which could not be the Monkes coming together to pray for the ſucceſs of their Army; for he had muſtered his Forces, and marched againſt them, before they came together to pray: It was then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that was that Cauſe, and that very cauſe was the Cauſe of their Slaughter; for ſure he did not march againſt them, with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſport with them, but to fight with them; and notwithſtanding any thing you have yet ſaid
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109869:31"/> to the contrary, (yea, doth not <hi>Beda</hi> ſay as much) that the cauſe was the refuſing of <hi>Austins</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the rejecting of <hi>Austins</hi> Traditions.</p>
               <p>Let me commend one <hi>Memento</hi> unto you (it may do you a pleaſure, if you will obſerve it whenſoever you ſhall have occaſion to write of the like ſubject) which is this: Where there are many different voluntary Agents, working ſubordinatly for the producing of an Effect, there may be different Ends aimed at in that Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whence I conclude, though you could num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as many final Cauſes of the ſlaughter of the Monks, as there were Hands acting in that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, yet this would not be any argument to prove, that <hi>Austin</hi> having an hand in it (as I have ſaid) did not look at this end, (to wit) the execution of Revenge for the affront he received from them by the Rejection of his Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And what though <hi>Beda</hi> ſay, that it was by the command of <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northumbers,</hi> that the Monkes were ſlain? Doth he ſay that he only was guilty of the Slaughter, and that <hi>Ethelbert</hi> was not there? He layes no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction upon that Action; therefore it is a wonder to me, how you can make that <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to bring forth that <hi>conſequence;</hi> this is a ſtrange kind of reaſoning to ſay, <hi>Beda</hi> makes mention of <hi>Edilfred,</hi> but ſays nothing of <hi>Ethelbert;</hi> therefore <hi>Edilfred</hi> was the only man that was guilty, and <hi>Ethelbert</hi> was not there; how much time muſt I allow you to ſpend, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an Argument able to prove this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be true? Suppoſe that you and I were travelling towards <hi>London</hi> together, and it ſhould be reported by one that met with us,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109869:32"/> that I was travelling that way, but no mention made of your Society; would this be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that you was not journeying with me? If you expect Hiſtorians alwayes to write the whole Truth, you expect that from them which they do not perform; it is known by experience, that as they are ſometimes <hi>redundant,</hi> ſpeaking more than Truth, ſo they are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>defective,</hi> relating not the whole Truth; therefore notwithſtanding any thing expreſſed by your Witneſs, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> might be with <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northumbers,</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> with them both, marching againſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and preſent at the ſlaughter of the <hi>Monkes,</hi> and ſo they all might have their hands imbrued in the Innocent Blood of that Murdered Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Now to prove that (as I ſaid in my Anſwer) <hi>Austin</hi> upon the Rejection of his Traditions, did ſtir up the Wrath of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> againſt them; and to prove, that though <hi>Beda</hi> ſay, that <hi>Edilfred</hi> was the Murderer of the Monks, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> was likewiſe guilty of that Horrid Fact, I have witneſs to produce as credible as your extolled <hi>Beda.</hi>

               <p>It is Recorded alſo in an Engliſh Chronicle, that when <hi>Austin</hi> came and told <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> that the <hi>Brittains</hi> would not obey him, that the King was Wroth, and ſent to <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbers,</hi> to come to help to diſtreſs the <hi>Brittains</hi> of <hi>Wales;</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> met with them at <hi>Leicester;</hi> the King of <hi>Leicester</hi> was called at that time <hi>Brocvale;</hi> he being afraid of the two Kings fled out of the Land and never came again; and the two Kings ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Lands, and parted them between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; afterwards they went towards <hi>Wales:</hi> The <hi>Brittains</hi> hearing of them, ſent men in their ſhirts unto them and barefoot to ask Mercy; but they were ſo cruel, that they had no pity on them.</p>

               <p>Beſides theſe Authorities, I would have you to conſider and weigh well the words of <hi>Beda,</hi> he ſays, that Auſtin <hi>foretold the Brittains in a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manner, that becauſe they would not accept of Peace with their Brethren, they ſhould have War with their Enemies; and if they would not Preach the doctrine of Life unto the Engliſh, they ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at their hands the revenge of Death:</hi> Was this a Propheſy or not? a Propheſy it could not be, for this was a method of prophecying, never uſed by any true Prophet: Our Saviour, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did not deliver his Prophecy in an ireful and threatning manner, but <hi>wept over it:</hi> And when the Lord commanded his Prophets, to go and Prophecy againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſins, we read, that many of them were loath to go at firſt, and all of them, when they did go and Prophecy, did deliver their Meſſage, not in an ireful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but rather mourning for, and lamenting the Condition of the People. And how could it be a Prophecy, when (as you ſay) all the difference that was between <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the <hi>Brittains,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome <hi>tollerable Matters?</hi> Could he Prophecy deſtruction unto them for that which deſerved no ſuch Retribution?

                  <hi>To my Anſwer to the third Query you reply thus: I can ſcarcely believe, that the world is ſo Lunatick in the affairs of Antiquity, for if you will take the paines to peruſe the beginning of the foreſaid book, entituled,</hi> the Proteſtants Apology for the Roman Church, <hi>you will ſee that theſe things came within the Cognizance of the Author thereof, and withal find ſubſtantial proof for the</hi> Affirmative <hi>of the ſaid Question, which may convince a</hi> non prejudging Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Rejoynder.</p>
               <p>I anſwered for my ſelf, taking you with me by the right hand of Fellowſhip, ſaying that neither you nor I was able to determine this <hi>Query</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly on either ſide, and ſhewed a Reaſon for it: You reply that you believe <hi>the world is not ſo lunatick in the affairs of Antiquity;</hi> but had you replied to purpoſe, inſtead of ſending me to your Author to ſeek for Arguments; you would have produced Arguments to void the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109869:35"/> force of my Reaſon; which being not done, it ſtands firm againſt you, and will ſtand againſt all Oppoſition; being there are no Records to inform us, what were the particular Tenets maintained by the ancient <hi>Brittains;</hi> neither you, nor I, nor any Man in the World, is able to make a certain Determination on either ſide.</p>
               <p>But what mean you by the <hi>World;</hi> if you mean the World, taken <hi>Diviſim,</hi> that is every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon in the World, I have cauſe to ſuſpect you of <hi>Lunacy,</hi> for employing your Faith after this manner: Do you think, that every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world, is able to make a certain Determination of this <hi>Query?</hi> if ſo, I expect to hear of ſome proof for it; for the proof you have here produced, is too ſcant to bear any proportion to that Latitude; if you could prove, that the Author, to whom you ſend me, was able to do this, it would be but a pitiful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove, that every particular Perſon in the World, was able to do ſo too.</p>
               <p>If by the World you underſtand ſome little Parcel of the World, and do take your Author to be that parcel, you bring the World into a very little Compaſs; and yet you have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this World to be able to make that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: If any ſuch Ability was in him, he hath hid <hi>his Light under a Buſhel,</hi> and kept it from the ſight both of me and you; you have not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned any of his Arguments, which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that you did not ſee any; and I have ſearched his Book, and do think my ſelf to be as quick-ſighted as you are, yet I cannot find any; no, not any thing in all his Book like unto an Argument to prove, that the Religion of the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> was the ſame with the Religion of the primitive Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Though there be no Inſufficiency in the actions or paſſions of Chriſt the head, yet his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Will and Juſtice requireth and ordaineth, that his body and members ſhould be fellows of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as they look to be fellows of his Glory; that ſo ſuffering with him and by his Example, they may apply to themſelves and to others, the general medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of</hi> Chriſts <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions, as it is alſo effectually applyed unto us by Sacraments; the one ſort being no more injurious to</hi> Chriſts <hi>death, nor conſequently hindring him of the whole Glory of the Work of Mans Salvation, then the other: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your vain Clamours, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſts paſſions, take away the value of</hi> Good Works; <hi>if you pleaſe to peruſe St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtle to the</hi> Coloſſians <hi>C. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Reply.</p>
                  <p>You muſt mean, that the Will and Wiſdom and Juſtice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> requireth paſſions in his Members, to merit the application of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> otherwiſe your whole diſcourſe is impertinent, to the thing you undertook to ſpeak of; for you undertook to ſpeak of <hi>Merit;</hi> and it ſeems you would have me to receive for a Truth, upon your own bare Word, all that you do ſay; for you have not ſhewed, where this Wiſdom and Will of Chriſt is revealed, and what Law there is for this act of Juſtice; no, nor diſcovered the leaſt hint of Reaſon to prove it.</p>
                  <p>You quote the Apoſtle to the <hi>Coloſſions. C. 1. V.</hi> 24. but I wonder that you are not aſhamed of the <hi>Impertinency</hi> of the Quotation; let his words be ſet upon the tenter hooks, yet they cannot be extended to include this ſenſe in them; here is not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109869:37"/> any thing of Merits in them, or of the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Merits of Chriſt,</hi> or of meriting that Application, or that the Will and Wiſdom and Juſtice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> requires paſſions for this end.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle tells the <hi>Coloſſions,</hi> that <hi>He ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them,</hi> but his meaning is this; to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to ſuffer by his Example, and to confirm the Truth of that Doctrine he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them: and he ſayes likewiſe that <hi>by his ſufferings he filled up that which was behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in his fleſh;</hi> from which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is to be gathered, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meaſure of ſufferings, which the Members of Chriſt are appointed to undergo, to which the malice of Hell cannot add to make it more, and the Apoſtle had his meaſure determined for him, to the filling up of which, the ſufferings he here ſpeaks of, conduced.</p>
                  <p>He termes them the <hi>afflictions of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they were laid upon him for Chriſts ſake, and by them he was made conformable unto Chriſt, and becauſe there is ſuch a near relation between Chriſt and his Members, that what is done unto them, he accounts as done unto himſelf. And he ſayes moreover, that the <hi>filling up of this Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> was for the ſake of Chriſts Church, that by his Courage and Conſtancy in ſuffering, he might draw ſome unto the Truth, and ſo increaſe the Church according to that ſaying, <hi>Sanguis Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum est ſemen Eccleſiae:</hi> and to confirm others in the Truth, and ſo as a Inſtrument to help to eſtabliſh the Church; This (without doubt) is the meaning of the Apoſtle; and if you will believe <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> you will take the word in this ſenſe; ſo that here is nothing to prove that ſtrange Doctrine which you deliver; here is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109869:38"/> nothing but your bare Affirmation for it, therefore I might juſtly ſend it away with a bare <hi>Negatur,</hi> until you find an opportunity to produce ſome better Arguments; Yet I ſhall beſtow ſome Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> You caſt an intollerable Slander upon us, while you ſay upon pretence of Chriſt's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we take away the value of <hi>Good Works.</hi> No Sir, we do not maintain any Opinion detracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from that price, we are warranted to ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; we maintain them for neceſſary uſes; they will be the Rule of Proportion, according to which, we ſhall have our Reward meted unto us, for the Lord will reward every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Works. We muſt have good Works to teſtify the truth of our Faith; for Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Works is dead. We muſt be full of good Works, to witneſs our Thankfulneſs unto God for benefits received: if we have not this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to produce, upon examination we ſhall be found an ungrateful People; and we muſt be fruitful in bringing forth of good Works, to give a good Example to our Brethren; for in this ſence we are our Brethrens Keepers: But we will not maintain with you, that we muſt have good Works to merit by them at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You confound Actions and Paſſions; you ſpeak here of the Paſſions of the Members of Chriſt, notwithſtanding you have undertaken to ſpeak of good Works; though they be really different, and ſometimes you ſpeak of them as ſuch; yet here you make them one and the ſame thing: Indeed it is a point of Policy, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be obſerved by the Abettors of Errours, to be mutable and moveable, to change, and to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109869:38"/> paſs from one thing to another; that when they are hunted from one Refuge, they may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Hole to creep into; and when one Card fails of winning the Game, they may have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ready to Play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have, with your own hands, pulled down that ruinous Fabrick, which your Intention was to ſupport. For firſt you ſay, There <hi>Is no Inſufficiency in the Actions and Paſſions of Chriſt.</hi> Hence it neceſſarily follows, That there is no Merit in the paſſions or actions of the Members of Chriſt: If Chriſt's Merits be ſufficient, there is no need of any other Merit; and if there be no need of any other Merit, then there is no other Merit: If you deny the truth of this Conſequence; you had beſt provide a ſubſtantial Argument ready to prove, that Chriſt requires that of his Members which is needleſs; for this proof will be required from you.</p>
                  <p>2. You ſay, That the Juſtice of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Paſſions in his Members; therefore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that there is not any Merit in the Paſſions of his Members: Juſtice, when it acts, looks at Man's deſert; therefore, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Paſſions in them, thoſe Paſſions muſt be laid upon them, upon the ground of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. And ſure you will confeſs, that Sufferings are evil in themſelves; it is then for ſome Evil of Sin acted by them, that the Evil of Sufferings is laid upon them; and pray let me hear of a ſubſtantial Argument to prove, that Suffering for Sin doth merit the application of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt: This would be good News for the Wicked in this World; yea, for the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Your Expreſſions are cloudy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109869:39"/> you are deſired to come out of the dark. And Firſt tell me what you mean by <hi>Fellows of Chriſt's Sufferings:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying of the Suffering condition of Chriſt in the World, delivers himſelf after this manner, in <hi>chap. 53. ver. 23, &amp; 24. He hath no Form nor Comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no Beauty that we ſhould deſire him; he is deſpiſed, and rejected of Men, a Man of Sorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Grief;</hi> and anſwerable to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy his condition was: If you mean, that all his Members are to be in the like Suffering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, while they are in the World; tell me how this can conſiſt with that which (you ſay) is one Mark of the Church, to wit, outward Proſperity, Luſtre, and Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tell me what you mean, when you ſay, <hi>That the Members of Christ are to ſuffer, that they may apply to themſelves, and to others, the general Medicine of Chriſt's Merits and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, as it is effectually applyed unto us by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi> do you mean, that there is Merit in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Sacraments?</hi> This muſt be your meaning, or elſe you do not make your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parata</hi> to agree to do you Service: And being that the holy Spirit works in the Uſe of the Sacraments, for the Application of the Merits of Chriſt, by making a tender of them, and by begetting of Faith to receive them; Do you mean, that the holy Spirit works, after the ſame manner, in the Paſſions of the Members of Chriſt? If you mean all this, where are your Arguments to prove all this to be true? I cannot diſcover here, ſo much as the ſhadow of an Argument; and until you produce ſome Proofs to confirm all this to be true, the Argument drawn from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109869:39"/> your Similitude, to prove that the Merit which (you ſay) is in Paſſions, doth not hinder Chriſt of any part of the Glory of Man's Salvation, is ſo weak in its Loyns, that it is not able to bring forth your Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you argue, The Merit of Paſſions doth no more hinder Chriſt of any part of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Man's Salvation, than the Uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; but the Uſe of the Sacraments doth not hinder Chriſt of any part of the Glory of Man's Salvation, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Your <hi>Major</hi> is a moſt falſe Aſſertion: In relation to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt's Glory, there is not the ſame working, or reaſon for working in both the things you ſpeak of: The Sacraments are no hinderance to Chriſt's Glory, becauſe there is not any Merit in the uſe of them; for the uſe of them is a Duty, and our Saviour tells you, (<hi>Luke chap. 17. ver.</hi> 10.) that there is not any Merit in the Performance of a Duty. Beſides, they are outward Means inſtituted by Chriſt, for this very end, <hi>The Application of the Merits of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo the whole Glory of the Work of Grace, that is wrought in the uſe of them, redounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but you maintaining Paſſions to Merit the application of the Merits of Chriſt, and theſe being no Means appointed by Chriſt, for the working of this end, do hinder Chriſt of the Glory due unto him: If you ſay they be Means, be pleaſed to ſhew me the Inſtitution of Chriſt for it.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, howſoever you judge of the matter, to ſay, that Paſſions do Merit the application of the Merits of Chriſt, is to ſay, that the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Chriſt is not free; and to ſay,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109869:40"/> that there is any Merit but in Chriſt, is to ſay, that the Merit of Chriſt is not ſufficient; both which are ſo great an hinderance to his Glory, that they are perfect Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, though the means that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, are no hinderance to his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet the means that are made by the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and device of Man, are an Hinderance in an high meaſure; for they ſpeak a diſtruſt in his Wiſdome, as if he was not wiſe enough to preſcribe an effectual Method, for the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Remedy, which is provided to Cure Man's Diſeaſe; and they exalt Man's Wiſdome above its reach. He was ſo fooliſh, as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf; but he was not ſo wiſe, as to find out a way for his Recovery: It is God that beſtows Salvation freely upon Man; and it is He that fits him with a Capacity to receive Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which Work, he performs after that manner which he hath appointed, and revealed in his Word; not after that manner, which vain Man doth invent, by the working of his fooliſh Imagination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You maintain two groſs Abſurdities here, one of them is mentioned already, and part of its abſurd nature ſhewed, and more of it will be ſhewed now: Firſt, that <hi>Paſſions do Merit the application of the Merits of Chriſt:</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth you other Doctrine, (<hi>Romans</hi> c. 8. v. 18.) <hi>That the ſufferings of this life, are not worthy to be compared unto the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> If they be not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared unto that Glory, they are not worthy of the Receipt of it; and if they be not worthy to receive it, they do not merit
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109869:40"/> the Application of thoſe Merits, which purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that glory.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon it ſelf will convince you of this, that Paſſions cannot be meritorious of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Merits of Chriſt; no, nor ſo much as a diſpoſed Capacity to receive them; for if they be either way for the application of the <hi>Merits of Chriſt,</hi> they muſt be previous (at leaſt in order of nature) unto that Application; but this they cannot be, for there can be no ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a member of Chriſt before man be made actually a member of Chriſt, (if he ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (he ſuffers but as a natural man) and man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be actually a member of Chriſt, before this application be made; for it is the Application of the merits of Chriſt, that makes him actually a member of Chriſt; therefore this Application muſt needs be before thoſe Paſſions, and then how can they be for the application of the merits of Chriſt, either by way of merit to deſerve them, or of Capacity to receive them: Say not now, that after the Application is made, Paſſions do merit a continuance of the Application; for upon the grounds that it is firſt made, upon the ſame it is continued, and that is only the love and mercy of God unto poor miſerable man.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond great Abſurdity is, <hi>that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Chriſt by Paſſions, do not merit only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but alſo for others: Where did you take up this Doctrine? I am ſure you did not find it in the <hi>Trent</hi>-Creed; therefore this being an Article of your Faith, I queſtion now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Religion you do profeſs, be as old as the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:109869:41"/>
                  <p>Is there ſo much redundancy of vertue in the paſſions of a member of Chriſt, that beſides what is neceſſary for himſelf, he hath ſome to ſpare for others; are you wiſer than the five wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, of whom we read in the Goſpel, they told the fooliſh, that they had no Oyl to ſpare to lend them? And dare you thus contradict the Holy Spirit, who tells you, that the <hi>Lord will reward every one according to his work?</hi> Math. 16. 27. And that <hi>every one must bear his own Burden.</hi> Gal. 6. 5. And that <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I would fain know, who theſe others are, to whom the Paſſions of a member of Chriſt will be thus profitable; they cannot be the members of Chriſt; for you ſay, that the Will and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Juſtice of Chriſt, requires that they ſhould have Paſſions of their own, for the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the merits of Chriſt unto themſelves; and theſe others cannot be ſuch as are not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; ſure you will not ſay, that the ſervants of <hi>Satan</hi> have the Merits of Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto them; it muſt remain therefore, that theſe others are ſome <hi>Ideas,</hi> that are ſubſiſting no where, but in your own Imagination.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle tells you, that Hereſy is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Gangreen; take heed that you be not infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Diſeaſe, your extolling of Actions and Paſſions above your Warrant, hath multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into many dangerous Opinions, and take heed that it eat not up all Faith; for if it once grow to that Malignity, it is not your own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Actions, nor the Paſſions or Actions of other men, that will procure the application of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109869:41"/> the Merits of Chriſt unto your ſoul.</p>
                  <p>After you have ſpent ſome breath in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Paſſions, you convert your ſpeech unto Actions, and then preſently you return to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions again. It ſeemes that you are ſomwhat like unto <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, hardly finding any reſt for the ſoles of your Feet; you are doubtful where you ſhould fix your Opinion of Merit with greateſt certainty, and there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this; for I am perſwaded, that if this <hi>Query</hi> were propounded to you, Whether paſſions or actions have more of Merit in them? there is ſo little in either, that to determine this, you would require as long a time as the man took, that undertook to teach an Aſſe to ſpeak.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus you expreſs your ſelf;</hi> neither do I ſee what pretence you can have <hi>to affirm, That the Merit of good Works hindreth God of the whole glory of the work of mans Salvation, ſeeing the ſaid Merit is the pure gift of God, and no leſs his than his own; for not only thoſe paſſions which Chriſt ſuffered in himſelf, which were fully ended at his Death, and were abundantly ſufficient for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and of all Sins: But alſo thoſe which his body and members ſuffer are Chriſts alſo, becauſe of him they receive the Condition, Quality, and Force, to be Meritorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reply.</p>
                  <p>Here are ſome expreſſions liable to Exception, while you ſay, That the paſſions of Chriſt are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109869:42"/> ſufficient for the Redemption of the world, and of all ſins; what Interpretation can you make of the latter words, as they are uſed in Coherence with the former? they cannot be explicatory of the former, becauſe the former are more plain; and if you will have them to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify ſomwhat that is not in the former, when you write again, be pleaſed to inform me, what it is: The world is Redeemed from Sin; but how the world can be ſaid to be Redeemed, and all ſin too, I do not well underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I apprehend to what purpoſe you have penned this Diſcourſe, telling me, <hi>That not only thoſe Paſſions, which Chriſt ſufferd in himſelf, which were fully ended at his Death,</hi> &amp;c. I have looked upon the Words with as much favor as you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to improve them to your Advantage, and yet they fail in my eyes of attaining that end. They relate unto theſe Words, and no leſs his, than his own: Do you mean that the Merit which he gives unto Good Works, is no leſs his, than the Merit of his perſonal Actions and Paſſions? If you mean this (as I ſuppoſe you do) for as much as I can perceive, there is no more Coherence between theſe Words and the following, than there is between the <hi>Poak full of Plumbs,</hi> and your Way to <hi>London,</hi> of which you tell me: If you can prove that I do wrong your Words, by imputing this unto them; I muſt ſay (what you do often ſay) that I have Miſtaken your meaning.</p>
                  <p>But howſoever it be, you maintain here two Falſe Poſitions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt gives Merit unto the Paſſions of his Members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:109869:42"/>2. <hi>That becauſe of this Merit which he gives unto thoſe Paſſions, they are his Paſſions:</hi> The one is the ground of the other; and if the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be ſandy, the Superſtructure muſt fall.</p>
                  <p>And that it is ſo, and that both theſe Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fall together, I ſhall prove, in anſwering that Argument, which you do here uſe to prove, That the Merit, which you pretend to be in Good Works, doth not hinder God of any part of the glory of Man's Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thus you Argue, That which God gives, is no hindrance to his Glory: But God gives the Merit that is in Good Works, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition you have left naked, without any proof; Yet in my conceit, it is ſo weak, that it ſtands very much in need of this ſupport: The thing that is given by God, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a two-fold Conſideration: It may be conſidered as given by God, or as imployed by. Man. And as imployed by Man, you muſt grant that it may be an hindrance to God's Glory; unleſs you will ſay, That man cannot Miſ-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, which, I hope, you will not do. God gives Meat, and Drink, and Riches to the Sons of Men, and yet you know that theſe things are Abuſed ſometimes unto his Diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>So I may ſay of that Merit, which you pretend to be in good Works; if I ſhould grant, that there is Merit in them, and that this Merit is given by God; yet if you ſhould miſ-imploy this, by truſting in it for the Salvation of your Souls, (whereas your whole confidence is to be placed in the Merits of Chriſt, which are the fruit of his perſonal Actions and Paſſions) that Merit
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109869:43"/> pretended by you to be in good Works, would be an hinderance to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is this, that God gives Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it unto good Works: Being that you ſay ſo, (though ſuch a Novice as I am, is not fit to give advice to ſuch a <hi>Gamaliel</hi> as you are, yet) vouchſafe to be perſwaded by me this once: Undeceive that poor people, over whom you have undertaken a Charge; tell them that all Merit belongs unto Chriſt; for you ſay, that the merit which is in good works in his Gift: tell them that the beſt of the Sons of men have not any merit of their own, neither for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor for others; for this is a neceſſary Conſequence of that which you ſay; that <hi>the Merit of good Works is Christs Gift,</hi> and Chriſts Merit: by this means you may be more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for the health of their ſouls, than as yet (I fear) you have been: I am of this opinion, that many poor ſouls have been deceived, in their hope of Salvation, by your maintaining of the Merit of good Works: for being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of that Curioſity, which you have conceived in your breaſt, and expreſſed here, and ſo not skilful enough to diſtinguiſh between their own Ability and Gift, but aſcribing that to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their works, which (you ſay) is <hi>Gods Gift;</hi> while they thought to fly into Heaven, by the Wings of their own Merit, (it being unfit, and unable for that ſervice) fell down to the Chambers of Death.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not ſuffer your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> to paſs thus; you left it as naked as your <hi>Major,</hi> though it ſtands in need of help, as much as any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109869:43"/> that you have made; for it is a moſt falſe Aſſertion, God gives not merit unto good Works; no, nor to the paſſions of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; the glory of meriting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only unto Chriſt; he humbled himſelf for it, he ſuffered for it, he dyed for it; and what he gained at ſo dear a rate, and is due unto him upon that account, will not be given unto another; you have a plain teſtimony for this in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, I am the Lord,</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>that is my Name; my Memorial will I not give unto another, nor my Praiſe unto graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Iſa. ch. 24. ver.</hi> 8. His Glory he will not give unto another. What other? Neither to Saints, nor to Angels, nor to Actions, nor to Paſſions, nor any thing elſe: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth this Doctrine, he tells you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Humiliation, Sufferings and Death of Chriſt, <hi>There is a Name given unto him above every Name; Phil. chap. 2. ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. How then can the name of Merit be aſcribed unto Actions and Paſſions as well as unto him, and as much as unto him? for pray conſider, whither (while you ſay that Paſſions do merit the application of the merits of Chriſt) you do not aſcribe as great a name of merit unto paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as you do give unto him; I am ſure, to merit the benefits of the Merits of Chriſt, is to merit all that Chriſt hath merited for us: And conſider well likewiſe, whether any Actions or Paſſions of men be capable to receive this.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe you have ſo little to ſay for Merit, and by that device which you uſe for the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109869:44"/> confeſs, that the head of that Stream is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for you ſay that God gives merit unto good Works, and to Paſſions, (that gift muſt be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Mercy, without any previous Merit); methinks you ſhould be eaſily perſwaded to leave talking of <hi>Merit,</hi> and to cry up <hi>Grace, Grace, Mercy, Mercy,</hi> only; this is <hi>via tuta,</hi> the ſafe way; for it is mercy only that is the ſaving help of miſerable ſinners.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the ſecond you anſwer likewiſe</hi> Affirmatively; <hi>but withall you ſay, you deny the ſiniſtrous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hence inferred, therefore we must not pray unto Saints; for (ſay you) it doth no more derogate from Christs whole glory of mediating for Sinners, to pray unto Saints in Heaven, than to pray unto Saints upon Earth: if it do, pray ſhew me the Diſparity; and yet your prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faithful upon Earth, doth not at all dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Christs whole glory; witneſs the practiſe of</hi> St. Paul <hi>in this point,</hi> Rom. <hi>chap.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Reply.</p>
                  <p>Here is a wonderful poſition maintained by you; to wit, that Saints on Earth are invocated and prayed unto: Is not prayer an act of religious Worſhip; and is that Worſhip performed unto any Mortal? It is true, there is a courſe of civil Entreaty ſometimes uſed to gain from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals the Object that is deſired; ſo Kings and Princes, and other great perſons are petitioned;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109869:44"/> and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth requeſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> (it is not an act of religious Worſhip that he performes, but an act of civil entreaty) but that the incenſe of prayer is offered up unto any mortal, is a thing that I never heard of before.</p>
                  <p>That you ſhould pray unto them, rather than to dumb Pictures and Statues, there is great reaſon; becauſe they reſemble the Creator and Saviour of the World, more than any Picture or Statue made by an Artificer: but if you do practice this, you are the firſt that I heard of, uſing this Practice; and I muſt tell you, that your praying to Saints upon Earth, and your praying to Saints in Heaven, are both diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Saviour of the World; for you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe unto them that worſhip which is due only unto God: God is ſtyled, the <hi>God that hears Prayer,</hi> therefore to him ought all fleſh for to go, <hi>Pſal. 65. ver.</hi> 2. And though you do not pray unto them directly for Grace or Glory, but only for the benefit of their mediation; yet you make them to ſhare in that Glory, which is wholly due unto Chriſt; for he is the <hi>only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and Man, 1 Tim. chap. 12. ver.</hi> 5. And beſides, you maintaining this needful to be done, do detract from the ſufficiency of the Mediation of Chriſt; if his mediation be ſufficient for a Sinner, the Mediation of Saints is needleſs; but if theirs be needful, then is not his ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>That we are commanded to deſire the Prayers of the Faithful upon Earth, I grant; but this deſire is not expreſſed by an Act of Religious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109869:45"/> Worſhip, ſuch as Prayer is; but by an act of civil Requeſt; which civil Requeſt cannot be made to the Saints in Heaven; becauſe we (wanting the liberty and conveniency of a nere Converſe) have not an opportunity for it; they are <hi>in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triâ,</hi> we <hi>in viâ;</hi> they are in Heaven, we on the Earth; we do injoy that Communion and Society with the Saints upon Earth, which we have not with the Saints in Heaven: Your own Schoolmen are uncertain, how they do hear Prayers, therefore they are not certain, that they do hear them; nay, they may be certain, that they do not hear them; for they are ignorant of the affaires of the World: <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſayes the Prophet) <hi>is ignorant of us,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael doth not acknowledge us,</hi> Iſa. chap. 63. ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder to me, that you dare be ſo bold, as to maintain this Aſſertion (having not the leaſt ſhadow of Proof for it); where is there an Injunction, or Preſident for it? Search the Book of God, from the <hi>Alpha</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the <hi>Omega</hi> of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> yet you will not find the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Much there is to be found againſt it; God bids you to call upon Him, and Chriſt bids you to come unto Him; and Chriſt hath taught you when you pray, not to ſay, <hi>Sancte Petre ora pro nobis,</hi> or <hi>Sancte Paule ora pro nobis,</hi> &amp;c. but to ſay, <hi>Pater noſter, qui es in Caelis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 50. ver. 15. Mat. c. 11. v.</hi> 28. And ſure you will not ſay, That Saints are to be believed in; you do not find this to be an Article of Faith in the Apoſtles Creed; and then the Apoſtle asks, <hi>How can you call upon him, in whom you
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109869:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> have not believed? Rom. c. 10. v.</hi> 14. But if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

God ſeeks us, before we ſeek unto him; and calls upon us, before we call unto him; and is more willing to give, than we to ask; and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hear us, than we are to pray unto him: And the reaſon why we do pray unto him, is not to inſtruct him in the knowledge of our Wants; but to obey his Command, and to own him for our Helper, and to expreſs our deſire to receive Help from him.</p>

                  <p>

If not, but differently proportioned, according to their different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of (as you ſay) Merits; Whether it be not the wiſeſt practice to pray unto them, that have the greateſt Prevalency? And that you may not be deceived in the uſe of this Practice, What mark of Diſtinction have you to know them by?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether the Mediation of Chriſt be not more prevalent, than the Interceſſion of all? If it be, we being aſſured, that Chriſt ſits at the Right Hand of God, making Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his own People, whether it be not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon this ground, to pray unto them?</p>
                  <p>I could propound many more, but theſe ſhall ſuffice: When you Write again, I hope you will ſay ſomewhat tending to a Reſolution of them, becauſe this is very neceſſary for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and practiſing of this your Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith.</p>

                  <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> When you do ſhew me a particular Article of Faith, wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and prove that Agreement by expreſs, and good Authority; I ſhall ſhew you particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Articles of Faith, wherein they differed; until then, it will be judged by any indifferent Arbitrator, ſufficient to tell you from your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Beda,</hi> That they differed about the way of Juſtice, the way to Heaven; and ſo great were there differences, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> Judged them worthy of Death.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Third,</hi> When I ſay, that the <hi>Monks</hi> were not ſlain by <hi>Edilfred</hi> King of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:109869:47"/> I will produce a ſubſtantial proof for it; I have proved, that they were ſlain by <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and that by the inſtigation of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> who was preſent at the Slaughter: My Affirmation, that they were ſlain by <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> doth no more exclude <hi>Edilfred,</hi> than <hi>Beda</hi>'s Affirmation, that <hi>Edilfred</hi> was the Murtherer, doth exclude <hi>Ethelbert</hi> from having an hand in the Slaughter; and that this may ſink into your Underſtanding for a truth, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether there may not be many co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Agents, working together for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of an Effect; and whether the Production may not be truly aſcribed to one of them, not mentioning the reſt; His <hi>Majeſties Fleet</hi> was out, under the conduct of the Prince, and the <hi>Duke,</hi> and ſhould I ſay, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were beaten by the <hi>Prince,</hi> not mentioning the <hi>Duke;</hi> or by the <hi>Duke,</hi> not mentioning the Prince, I ſhould ſpeak nothing but truth.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Fourth,</hi> This ſufficient proof may be conſidered divers ways, in relation to yours, or my own, or the Readers Judgement, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to yours: If I muſt ſtick until the Proof be ſufficient, perhaps I may ſtick until the laſt day; if you be reſolved to ſhut your Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, I know no body bound to ſtick in proving until you open them; what I have undertaken to prove, to my own, and (I hope) to the indifferent Readers Judgement, is ſufficiently proved; and what I ſhall do hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (I hope) will proceed from me in the like Strength.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:109869:47"/>
                  <p>To the <hi>Fifth,</hi> If you will not (as the Heathen Oracles heretofore did) deliver your ſelf in a doubtful Manner, but will ſpeak your mind plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; there will be no cauſe to fear a Miſinterpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but however, if I do wreſt your words to a wrong ſence, I hope you are able enough to tell me in particular, wherein I am Guilty; which (if you do it) will oblige me to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of thanks, for dealing fairly with me: I would not have you to deal with me again, as you have done already in your Reply; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you accuſe my anſwer of this Guilt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but you ſhew nothing in particular to prove the Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>Thus (I conceive) your <hi>Remora</hi> is removed, and now I am at liberty to improve the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> to the demoliſhing of your Religion; yet there is one way left to prevent this Exerciſe, which is your returning to my Rejoynder, and rejoyning to this Reply: which if you do (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not have too great a weight to lye upon my weak ſhoulders at once) I ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my ſelf wholly in defence of what I have written; but if (after ſome time of expectation) I find you unwilling to grapple any farther, (Providence permitting and aſſiſting me) I ſhall (according to the Tallent beſtowed upon me) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to demonſtrate, that many Tenents of your Religion are injurious to the Glory of God, who is the <hi>Author of Mans Salvation;</hi> and to the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is mans <hi>Mediatour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor;</hi> and that they exalt man far above his height, who is ſo worthleſs, and unworthy, that the beſt plea that he can make for himſelf before

                  </p>
                  <p>And now I proteſt to the World my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as to that Charge you brought againſt me in your Reply, accuſing me for giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, and exaſperating Language; that I have not either in my Anſwer, or in this Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Reply, given the leaſt word ſounding to that purpoſe: Wherefore (when you Write again) if your Will be diſpoſed to renew your Charge (my ſtrain of Writing being (though low, yet as I conceive, ſtill the ſame) you are required to mention the particular word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have transgreſſed the rules of Civility and Modeſty; and if I do not clear my ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Face of any indifferent Judge, let me and my Cauſe bear the Blame, and the ſhame of it for Ever.</p>

               <p>S. F. having formerly put himſelf upon anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Quaeries concerning points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and thereby engaged himſelf in a formal diſputation, after much pains taken therein, both by himſelf and the perſon, whom he had made his Antagoniſt; the matter at laſt, as it ſeems, was laid aſide, whether becauſe his Adverſary left the Country, or elſe ſeeing the Diſputation was likely to prove both fruitleſs and endleſs, he thought it not worthy his further notice; I can only give a bare conjectural Reaſon, becauſe I never yet underſtood who this perſon was; nor did I ever hear any thing of this ſo much <hi>Celebrated Piece</hi> till now, altho' the Authour of it hath boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much that it hath travilled all <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> over to meet with an Anſwerer, but never hath found any ſo daring as to encounter it, ſo that needs it muſt remain victorious and unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and upon this acount was intended very ſpeedily for the Preſs. But amidſt theſe vapours, one replying that this ſeemed very ſtrange, being that they never yet had heard of any thing that came forth, even by the moſt Learned, of the Proteſtant Religion, which had not been fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. The Authour therefore reſolved that it ſhould firſt be ſhewed to a certain Perſon, who it might be conceived had never heard of it by reaſon of his late coming into thoſe Parts; and accordingly ſent it with this aſſurance, that if he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109869:49"/> did not anſwer it, it ſhould very ſpeedily be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; his Anſwer hereunto was, that if it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfaction and truth that he aimed at, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelf obliged, both in civility and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to endeavour it; ſo to ſave him both the trouble and charges; but inſtead of a Paper as it was told him, receiving a formal piece of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie already ſwell'd up to half a ſcore ſheet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109869:49"/> more a friend; and to convince himſelf likewiſe how much he was an hearty well wiſher of him. This Letter, although, free from intending the leaſt prejudice to any one, and only in general expreſſing the inconveniencies, which but too frequently enſue upon ſuch like occaſions, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward anſwered by <hi>S.

This made him abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſit down in a proteſt ſilence, becauſe it was not then an hard matter to foretell what would be the event of ſuch a Controverſy, and what credit to himſelf, or ſatisfaction to others might be expected, when ſuch a <hi>Letter,</hi> not Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion was now become the ſubject of ſo furious a Conteſt; and therefore he would make an end of it with another <hi>Letter</hi> to inform him only of this his reſolution, and his reaſons why; let him make what ſiniſtrous uſe of it he pleaſed, if it needs muſt be underſtood contrary to the ſincerity and candour of it, or the former intended. This <hi>laſt Letter</hi> was ſo heinouſly taken, becauſe he will neither allow one to vindicate himſelf from his accuſations, as far as is reaſonable; nor yet which is a far harder cafe, to ſit quiet, and let him ſay what he pleases, and alſo perhaps becauſe he foreſaw that his Book was in danger to be ſent back without an anſwer unto it, which he ſeemed all along to be afraid of; that whoſoever hath but heard how violent and paſſionate he hath been in his expreſſions, diſcourſing with ſeveral perſons ſince the recite of that <hi>Letter,</hi> would now at leaſt condemn him of a guilt a perſonal quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though there was no ſuch charge brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Papers in either of thoſe <hi>Letters,</hi> and commend

               <p>But ſtill <hi>S. F.</hi> continuing his importunities of having his Papers anſwered, or elſe acknowledged as unanſwerable: I was deſired by a very worthy Perſon whom he had likewiſe importuned very much for an anſwer, and whoſe requeſt to me is always an obliging command, to look over them, and to conſider how far they might in any wiſe deſerve an anſwer, if perhaps for the future it might be thought convenient to ſend one without detaining them any longer; finding my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under this obligation; and after ſome time alſo in ſuch a condition that I could afford my ſelf a little leaſure, I purpoſed to peruſe thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; though I muſt confeſs not without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unwillingneſs as to the thing it ſelf, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo but too fully ſatisfi'd, That Opinions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies once raiſed, are ſeldome or never laid by reaſon, becauſe for the moſt part, the one Party puts on a reſolution never to yield to the other, or never to acknowledg himſelf ſatisfied and his judgment convinced, though it be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced, both by Scripture, Authority of the Church, Councels, Fathers, or whatſoever: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will only be tyed to his own rule; and neither ſhall that ſignifie any thing, unleſs applied as he will himſelf; ſo that in effect he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his own Judge, which is a certain way of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, at leaſt in his own conceit, and in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the meaner ſort of capacities, whom therefore ſuch an one will not fail to amuſe and inveigle with boaſting words; and if there comes not forth immediately an Anſwer or Reply to every petty quibble, and exceptious cavil, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to proclaim it unanſwerable, and cry out
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109869:50"/> victory, becauſe very few, or ſcarce any Body hath heard of it, and no Body judges it worth the taking notice of: Truly, it ſeems to me no ſmall piece of fondneſs and extravagancy for any private perſon to buiſie himſelf now-adays in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt Points of Religion, and trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either with reading, or anſwering his Books; when as the multitude already written upon that Subject, and affording incomparably more ſatisfaction, hath long ſince made the world to nauſeate; and yet they are ſo far from deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any one Point controverted, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give growth unto it through intereſt and paſſion, than any ways abate the fury of hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders by reaſon. This I ſay not to decry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, or a prudent and ſerious examine and inquiry into the Truth; but the wilful abuſes and paſſionate errours that are committed in the management of them, and the induſtry that is uſed to render them unprofitable, and endleſs; ſo that in fine, inſtead of putting an end to one Controverſie, they often beget another, which is, whoſe Pen hath beſt expreſſed his paſſion not kept cloſe to the matter controverted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed it with reaſon. Now whether or no the learned Controvertiſt hath taken ſuch a Courſe as to obſerve the one, and avoid the other, I leave to the judgment of the diſcreet and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reader, having firſt offered to his conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe few <hi>Reflections</hi> upon his method and way of anſwering, and afterward ſomewhat in anſwer not to every quible and captious criticiſm, for that would be both endleſs, and below the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſeriouſneſs of the thing treated of, but only ſo far as may ſuffice to inform the Authour of his inſincere dealing, and give ſatisfaction both to him and the prudent Conſiderer.</p>

               <p>FIrſt therefore by that ſhort peruſal that I have made of this piece of Controverſie, I can only gather, that the Ground of this was no other than that the Perſon whom <hi>S.

And this by ſhewing that it is the ſame Religion which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and Apoſtles of <hi>England</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Saxons;</hi> that which he taught the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to be the ſame with the Religion he profeſſed amongſt the <hi>Britains;</hi> and that of the <hi>Britains</hi> to be the ſame with the Religion which was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>England</hi> by its firſt Converters. Now I ſee no reaſon why any one ſhould ſo heavily fall out with this way of proceeding; for certainly had he taken the pains to have derived the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion through every Century from the Apoſtles Time downwards to this preſent; and that by ſhewing a viſibility, and a continued and an interrupted ſucceſſion of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

F.</hi> might have ſaid with as much reaſon, or more, that he had made a Journey of ſixteen miles about, as that he hath made a Journy of three miles about, when one would have ſer-as well. Whereas certainly to ſee a Religion proved to be viſibly handed down through all Ages, and conſerved in the ſame purity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

               <p>ALthough to any rational Perſon not blinded with paſſion, or prepoſſeſſed with errour, antiquity alone and ſucceſſion of that Religion, which is acknowledged by all to be the only true one, would be a ſufficient manifeſtation of the true Religion; Truth only being able to prevail at laſt, and yet with <hi>S.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109869:52"/> Religion, as well as we grant them the one, and deny the other of their Religion: whereas all Chriſtians being agreeed thus far, that is all of them pretending to profeſs the Faith and Law of Chriſt, and to have their Religion, Sacraments, and Doctrine from him, cannot in reaſon urge one another with thoſe ſame arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Infidels do impugn us; and which all Chriſtians are equally obliged to deny, and to anſwer alike: nor can they without a manifeſt contradiction anſwer us in this particular as a Turk or Jew would do, unleſs they will deny their own principles, betray their belief, and renounce Chriſtianity; but muſt of neceſſity grant, That that Religion which is moſt antient, and which is proved to be unalterably derived by a continued and interrupted Succeſſion from him that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by both Parties to be the Authour of the True Religion, is to be admitted of as true by all; and conſequently the continuance and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of it allowed as undeniable marks and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies thereof.

               <p>This in the judgment of any indifferent or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious perſon, muſt needs ſeem an unreaſonable thing to be demanded, firſt becauſe he had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before declared, that although it were ſo yet it ſhould ſignifie no more with him, then if a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew</hi> pleaded the ſame; ſo that it is ſo far from being a reaſonable requeſt, that every body will grant, that it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world, to urge any one to prove a thing, and at the ſame time to declare that the proof of it ſhall be of no benefit or advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; beſides it is otherwiſe an unreaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or demand, ſince that the Proteſtants, of whom he profeſſes himſelf (as I ſuppoſe) to be one, pretending to the title of Reformers, muſt needs grant as the word it ſelf doth import, that they found the Catholick Religion in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but all the Chriſtian world over, with the unanimous and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Nations, without either diſturbance or contradiction; but on the contrary flouriſhing in the greateſt calm, peace and ferenity that could be, till <hi>Martin Luther</hi> made an oppoſition and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109869:53"/> rebellion; but whether upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or Deformation and Paſſion, might eaſily be made to appear, were it proper for this place; His own words to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> are a convincing argument, where he told the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> perſwading him for Gods ſake, to return to the obedience of his Holy Mother, the Catholick Church; this quarrel was not begun for Gods ſake, neither for Gods ſake, ſhould it be ended; ſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being thus ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in an Ancient Poſſeſſion, and that ſuch an one, that at leaſt in the Judgment and Confeſſion of the Proteſtants themſelves was juſtly prefumable to have come from Chriſt, ought not in any wiſe, to have been diſturbed therein, without ſufficient motives, and very weighty and evident reaſons, poſſeſſion it ſelf alone being a ſufficient Title, till evident and rigorous Proofs, not bare preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and probabilities are brought againſt it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate it and ſhew that it is wrongful; as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable out of the principles both of Nature and Reaſon, as alſo by the practice of the Laws of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as our Lawyers will tell you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give you a number of examples and inſtances according to the common Maxim, <hi>Melior eſt conditio peſſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> A Religion therefore the moſt antiently ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, the moſt univerſally acknowledged, the moſt apoſtolically delivered, and the only one in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and being through the Chriſtian world, as the Catholick was at the time of the firſt breach, ought not in common reaſon to have been changed or diſobeyed upon pretences, ſuppoſitions, and meer probabilities, but ought to have been obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admitted off, as the only true and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, till the contrary had been evinced and Demonſtrated by moſt rigorous and manifeſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109869:54"/> Proofs, by this the reader may judg whether par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtandes oblidged to bring a ſubſtantiall Proofe the Catholicks an affirmative for the antiquity and continuance of their Religion, or the Proteſtants a negative againſt it, as alſo whither the demand was reaſonable or unreaſonable, and truly though it had been a reaſonable requeſt, yet it muſt needs be a great deale of ſeverity to complain that it is not fulfilled before it was requeſted; and becauſe Catholicks prove not what was not required of them, they muſt needs therefore be compared to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> taskmaſters.</p>

               <p>MY fourth and laſt <hi>Reflection,</hi> is upon his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and way of proceeding, as being both diſorderly and unconcluſive; for had he had a mind to have proceeded ſolidly in a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about points of Religion, it being a thing of the greateſt importance that may be, he ought rather to have laid down ſome principle felf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; or as they ſay in Schools, <hi>per ſe notum,</hi> as a foundation to build his diſcourſe on, and to have nominated alſo a Judg to determine whatſoever ſhould be controverted betwixt them, and not to run and chaſe from one thing to another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fixing upon any thing certain, or able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the thing in Controverſie: for to any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſon it muſt needs appear, that it will prove both an unprofitable and endleſs diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when one Party ſays one thing, the other quite another, without being firſt agreeed upon ſome one Principle, or Rule to be directed by. Now had this learned Diſputant aſſigned any ſuch Rule, or Judg to give judgment in behalf of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109869:54"/> what he had objected againſt the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it would have been either allowed of, or diſallowed by his Adverſary; and if allowed of, the buſineſs would have come to a fair and ſpeedy Tryal; or elſe if he had required this from the Deſendant, and diſproved of what he had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to decide the difference betwixt them, then might he with credit have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſuch a power; and with the ſame blow like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the whole Fabrick of the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for if we do not know whether a line, or a piece of wood be ſtreight or crooked, but by applying a Rule unto it, by which we may be enabled to judg of its ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109869:55"/> ſubject to errour; ſo that to paſs ſentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Religions, evincing the one of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood and the other of truth; there is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity required an infallible Rule to go by; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Guide for direction, and unerring Judg to give ſentence, without which there can no be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility or certainty of truth in this Deciſion. I eaſily foreſee what Mr. <hi>S. F.</hi> will object againſt this, that it either equally touches both Parties, or elſe it doth not at all concern him. For the prevention of which evaſion I anſwer, that he being the Oponent, and undertaking to write againſt a Religion maintained by its Profeſſours to be infallibly true, cannot in reaſon ſeek to overthrow it, unleſs by arguments and reaſons, which are manifeſt and certainly convincing: who therefore ſhall be the Judg of this? himſelf that were unreaſonable, unleſs he will pretend to have the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of infallibility beſtowed upon him; he ought therefore to ſubmit them to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment of ſomething infallibly able to judge of them, and determine the buſineſs; and if he leaves it to the Catholicks nomination, he might both complain of partiality, and expect to have them retorted upon himſelf, at leaſt if he will be ſo daring, it ought to be by his own free election; ſo that the obligation lies wholly upon himſelf. Indeed in his Papers he ſpeaks of an infallible Rule, conformable unto which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that our Proofs be, and then he will be of our Religion; but to keep himſelf out of this danger; and becauſe he dares not ſtand to the judgment and determination of it, being already aſſured that he ſhall bring a ſtaff to his own head, and find his Religion to be diſagreeable unto it: he tells us not what this infallible Rule is; nor can I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109869:55"/> imagine what he means by it, if he will ſtick to the Proteſtant Principles, for Scripture alone it cannot be, for the reaſons I have given before, Traditions they will not allow of; Councels they reject, and to the Fathers they grant not ſo much Authority; ſo that although now and then they pick out ſome ſentences out of them, yet they hold them not at all to be deciſive, but take and leave them at their pleaſure, juſt as Mr. <hi>S. F</hi> hath done in his rejoynder, where he quotes St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his 9 <hi>hom.</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> for the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture; and produces a ſaying of that holy Father indiſcreetly ſpoken, and making nothing at all for his purpoſe, as will appear hereafter; and all along never takes notice of the difficulty of underſtanding it; of which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> Treats <hi>ex profeſſo;</hi> nor how he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles grace and merit, of both which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes at large; the conſideration of which if Mr. <hi>S.

            <p>I Had purpoſed neither to have given my ſelf or the Reader any further trouble, but that in his rejoynder I found him ſaying, that to grant that our Religion is the ſame with <hi>Auſtines,</hi> is the ſame with the Antient <hi>Brittans,</hi> and theirs the ſame with that which was firſt brought into <hi>England,</hi> is in effect to ſay, that our Religion is the ſame that was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and conſequently to grant ours to be the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to renounce the Proteſtants as falſe, ſo that a Proteſtant as a Proteſtant (he ſays) cannot grant us this, and yet a little before, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the queries, he is ſo liberal, that he cares not how much of antiquity he grants us, becauſe he profeſſes that it is of no advantage, nor ſhall it ſignifie any more, that our Religion is the ſame with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the <hi>Brittans,</hi> than if a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Turk</hi> pleaded the antiquity of theirs, which he ſays, they may do with as much Probability. This put me alſo in mind of his former anſwer to the firſt query, which was Negative, preſuming that St. <hi>Auſtines</hi> Religion was the ſame with that which his Maſter Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> profeſſed, from which he boldly undertakes to prove evidently out of St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> own words, that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion differs in all theſe particulars; the Canon of the Scripture, the real Preſence, the private Maſs, Communion in both kinds, merit of good Works, veneration of Images and the Popes Supremacy;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109869:56"/> his Doctrine in theſe (as he ſays) being the ſame that is maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is evident; ſo that now you ſee him in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt contradiction of himſelf, making that which before was of ſo little value and advantage, to be now the ſum of the whole controverſy, nay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he had all along treated St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently, as to make him guilty of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and of many other miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, yet now on the contrary ſide the main buſineſs is to find out what his Religion was, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become even the Rule of his beliefe, and that which the Proteſtant Religion muſt ſtand or fall by.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I did not a little wonder at this unexpected change, but much more at his great undertakings; but becauſe it is one thing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, and another to perform, this being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be of ſo great concern, I could not let it paſs unexamined, becauſe here at length I thought I had ſomething more certain to build upon, but muſt needs ſee how well he had acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf of his own impoſed task, and made it evidently appear that St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not profeſs the Catholick Religion, but that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let us therefore now examine whether or no, he has done it with as much ſolidity and truth, as he ſays he had done it with eaſe.</p>
            <p>Againſt the Canon of the Scripture, he cites St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaking thus, <hi>Non inordinate agimus, ſi ex libris licet eon Canonis ſed tamen ad edificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem editis teſtimonium proferamus;</hi> which in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſignifies no more, then that it is not amiſs ſometimes to bring a Teſtimony or proof out of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109869:57"/> the books, though they be not Canonical, yet if they be put forth for edification.</p>
            <p>Although I have diligently ſought for this place in St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> yet I cannot find any ſuch thing in him, nor ſo much as ſuch an Article, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth of this quotation, how doth the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent make it evident that St. <hi>Grogory</hi> ſpeaks here of the firſt and ſecond book of <hi>Machabees,</hi> rather then of the third and fourth, which neither the Catholick Church holds to be Canonical? he tells you out of <hi>Canus</hi> ſpeaking of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> thus, * <hi>Machabeorum libros ab eccleſia recipi Gregorio li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit aliquando diſputare, Gregory</hi> was pleaſed for a time to diſpute, whether the book of <hi>Machabees</hi> were received by the Churchor no? he did well to put neither of theſe Texts into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince they make ſo little for his purpoſe, for firſt <hi>Canus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpeaks only in general of them, withour par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioning either one or other, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he ſays only, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was pleaſed to hold them as diſputable, not that he did reject and condemn them all as <hi>Apocriphal,</hi> as the Church of <hi>England</hi> abſolutely doth.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew him all the Favour that may be, let us ſuppoſe that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> does here ſpeak of all the Books of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> not collectively taken; for in that acception it would ſtill make more againſt him, but diſtributively, as well of the firſt and ſecond, as of third and fourth, it can be only inſerred from thence, that they were not declared to be Canonical in his time, but it doth not prove that they were then either rejected as Apocryphal, or that they are not ſince decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="bottom">

            <p>Concerning then the ſufficiency of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, he brings a Saying out of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> viz. <hi>In hoc volumine omnia quae erudiunt, cuncta quae aedificant ſcripta continentur,</hi> In the Holy Scriptures are contained all things that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for inſtruction and edification.</p>
            <p>This is eaſily anſwered by granting him all the Words import, only I deſire to know how we may come rightly to underſtand them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſtaking the true Senſe; being that there are many things in Scripture ſo deep and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious, that they tranſcend all humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo that though it be ſufficient if rightly interpreted and underſtood, yet it is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient interpreter of it ſelf. For anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I remit you to the Divine Words of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Lyrin,</hi> in his Golden Book he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prophane Innovations of Hereſie: Here ſome perhaps may ask, foraſmuch as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109869:59"/> the Canon of the Scripture is perfect, and in all points very ſufficient in its ſelf, what need is there to join the Authority of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; Underſtand (ſo he calls the Churches Sence, and the Fathers interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) for this cauſe ſurely, for that all take not the holy Scripture in one and the ſame ſence, becauſe of the deepneſs thereof, ſome interpreting it one way, ſome another; ſo that there may almoſt as many Sences be pick'd out of it as there be men; for <hi>Novatian</hi> doth expound it one way, and <hi>Sabellus</hi> another, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Donatus,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Arrius, Eunomius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Photinas, Apollinaris, Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillian;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Jovin, Pelagius;</hi> laſtly, otherwiſe <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> And therefore very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is, by reaſon of ſo great windings and turnings of divers Errors, that the Line of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Apoſtolical Interpretation be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected according to the Rule of the Ecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Catholick Sence and Underſtanding.

            <p>The Occaſion of S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s writing this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to acknowledge the Receipt of a Sum of Money which he had received from this <hi>Theodorus,</hi> to be beſtowed among the Poor, and for the Redemption of Captives; S. <hi>Gregory</hi> thereupon writes unto him in commendation of his Charity, and withal adviſed him to read the Holy Scriptures for a farther increaſe in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Love of God. Now you ſee this <hi>Theodorus</hi> was pious, and although a Lay-man, yet a Scholar, as you may ſuppoſe, being a Phyſitian; but you do not find in all this, that <hi>Gregory</hi> perſwaded him to read the Scriptures to make himſelf Judge of Controverſies, or to interpret them according to his own fancy, but only for his Devotion and Encouragement in the Service of God. And this is the conſtant Practice and Advice of the Catholick Church to ſuch as are diſcreet, and not likely to make ill uſe of it, but not without reſtraint to every Girl, and Enthuſiaſtick Woman, and felf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Artificer, who may have it explicated piouſly, and fitted much better to their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, without the danger of miſtaking it, by Learned Expoſitors in their Books of almoſt any ſort. Alas, methinks the too lamentable effects which have happened by the too much toſſing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109869:60"/> and reading of the Holy Scripture, or rather abuſing of it, ſhould convince any conſidering and well-meaning Perſon of the great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that enſue upon it, when not a ſilly Girl, if ſhe has but learned to read, but muſt have her Bible with her to Church, and there upon Preſumption of Wit, or I cannot tell what Spirit, make her ſelf not only Reader, but a Teacher, Controuler and Judge of Church, Scripture, Teachers and all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding the leaſt difficulty in the <hi>Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> or in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> though they contain as many Myſteries as Words; it ſeems not to them a ſacred Book claſped with ſeven Seals, as it did to <note n="*" place="bottom">Apoc. 5. 1.</note> S. <hi>John,</hi> nor need they an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as the holy Eunuch did, that was Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 6.</note> 
               <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, when he cried out, <hi>O wonderful Profoundneſs of thy Words! wonderful Profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my God! wonderful Profoundneſs! it maketh a man to quake to look on it, to quake for reverence, and to tremble for love thereof!</hi> So that being it is ſo hard to be underſtood, even by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Reaſon methinks ſhould dictate and tell us, that they were not ordained indifferently to be read by all; and by ſad experience we ſee the Inconveniences: for although the Letter were moſt pure and not corrupted in it ſelf, which yet cannot poſſibly be expected amidſt ſuch a variety of diſagreeing Tranſlations, yet the Sence is ſtill in danger of being corrupted, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, and adulterated; as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

What would he then have ſaid, if then there had been ſo many falſe Tranſlations, and Corruptions of Scriptures as are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, threatning no leſs than the Ruine both of Church and State. To conclude, S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Words make nothing for this licentious and popular reading of the Scripture, as it is uſed now adays, to intermeddle and judge of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, but only for inſtruction of Life and Manners; and ſo the Catholick Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of it; but as the <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. <hi>c. 12. v. 4,</hi>

            <p>This is ſo far from being oppoſite to the Real Preſence, that it is very agreeable to the Catholick Doctrine in that point, and very much contrary to what the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:109869:61"/> holdeth. For firſt, he ſpeaketh of a Sacrifice, which Catholicks allow of; whereas Proteſtant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deny all true, proper, real and external Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and afterwards he ſays, that is done in imitation of the Paſſion of Chriſt, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Catholick Doctrine, and does no way deny the Real Preſence of our Saviour Chriſt in the Bleſſed Sacrament, becauſe the Paſſion was a bloody and general Sacrifice, but this Sacrifice of the laſt Supper, or the holy Maſs is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation unbloody, and particular Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, applying the ſaid general and bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto us; ſo that although in this ſence it be in imitation, it is nevertheleſs real. This more fully appears by the words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text; for immediately before S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the greatneſs of this Sacrifice, and of the manner of our Saviour's being in the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, that is, after a Divine, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and impaſſible manner, he adds, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt being riſen again from Death, does now die no more, nor ſhall Death have any farther Dominion over him, yet living in himſelf immortally and incorruptibly, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſacrificed for us in this Myſtery of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oblation or Maſs, for there his Body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, his Fleſh is diſtributed for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his People, and his Blood is not powred out by the hands of Infidels, but received by the mouths of the faithful.

               </gap> Apoſtles, or whether the Apoſtles and the Primitive Chriſtians did in like manner at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times practiſe the ſame? All this we are agreed of: but the thing in controverſie is, whether Chriſt did command the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both kinds to the Laity; and whether the Eſſence and Subſtance of the Sacrament be entire in one, or no? Now the Catholick Church holdeth, and hath always taught, That there is no Neceſſity or Divine Precept for the Laity to communicate under both kinds, but it is ſufficient and lawful for them to do it either under one kind or both; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt himſelf, and alſo his Apoſtles did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament to the Laity under one; ſo that the Precept herein, being not Divine, but only Eccleſiaſtical, the Church has power to ordain and diſpenſe with it, according to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109869:63"/> the various Exigencies and Occaſions of Times and Places; and accordingly ſometimes has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of Communion under both kinds, and at other times has forbidden it, as ſhe judged it more expedient for the Receivers, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the Sacrament it ſelf. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, This Saying imputed to S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies nothing of a Command, or of a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of receiving under both kinds, without which, the Sacrament would not be entire, which is the thing Mr. <hi>S.

Gregory</hi> or any other of the Fathers ſpeak of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties receiving under both kinds, they ſpeak of ſuch Times in which the Church ſo appointed and commanded the Adminiſtration of it, which is not at all againſt us; but rather by ſhewing a difference in Practice at ſeveral times, confirms the Authority and Power of the Church, in commanding the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Laity either under one, or both kinds.</p>

            <p>This likewiſe I ſhall anſwer by ſhewing brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the belief of the Catholick Church is in this point, which teacheth that it is good and lawful, and profitable to keep holy Images and Pictures of Chriſt and his Saints, to ſet them up in Churches, and to give them a relative Honour. Now let the Reader compare the Words of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> with this, and tell us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are oppoſite: For firſt S. <hi>Gregory</hi> blames this <hi>Serenus</hi> for breaking down the Images; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he tells him, he ought to have taken away the Abuſes, not the Uſes of them, which is agreeable to the Catholick Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, forbidding all Divine Honour to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, but only a relative or inferior ſort of Honour or Reſpect agreeable to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which they do repreſent. And ſecondly, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> allows of the Uſe of them as pious and profitable, though they are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſed; for certainly were the Uſe of a good thing to be taken away, becauſe it may be abuſed, we ſhould in a ſhort time have very few good things left us; for which S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in the words immediately following, gives this Reaſon; becauſe, ſaith he, Images are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kept in Churches, to the end that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant may at leaſt read upon the Walls, what they cannot in Books; you ought therefore, ſaith he, both to have preſerved them, and yet to have hindred the People from the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What S. <hi>Gregory</hi> therefore taught in this Point, is ſo clear, that I will appeal herein to the Proteſtant Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who all of them reprove him for his

               <p>I Have now anſwered all the objections pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be taken out of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> without any farther examine or ſearch into the nature of either his <hi>Queries,</hi> Anſwers, or the reſt of his Rejoynder, further than as I have briefly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them in my <hi>Reflections,</hi> hoping they will prove rational and ſatisfactory enough; conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering beſides, that the greateſt part of the Controverſie (excepting the arguments out of St. <hi>Grogory</hi>) was come to be rather concerning Hiſtorical Reports than matters of Faith: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109869:65"/> as touching what I have ſaid in anſwer to the objections out of St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> I was the more eaſily perſwaded unto it, becauſe, there at leaſt, I ſaw ſomething to build upon, which was the authority of that holy Father, whom he ſeemed to be willing to ſubmit unto as a Judg, becauſe he had often promiſed not a wreſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the ſence, but evident proofs out of the Father's own words; ſo much authority did he ſeem to allow the holy Doctor; but one may preſume it was only in thoſe particulars, wherein he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In anſwering his objections, I have ſtudied rather brevity than multiplicity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; making it only my deſigned Task, which I wiſh the Reader to take notice of) to ſhew the true ſence and meaning of S. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s words, and how agreeable, if rightly underſtood, they are to the Catholick Doctrine, and diſagreeable to that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is all that any one in reaſon can expect in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109869:66"/> this being abſolutely oppoſite to what Mr. <hi>S.

The thing in controverſie being at preſent, not whether thoſe aſſertions were true or falſe; but whether S. <hi>Gregory</hi> held them or no; for this reaſon therefote, and for a final prevention of all farther cavilling ſhifts, and evaſions which might be made, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The <hi>Queries</hi> (I confeſs) were not brought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to my hands, but delivered to a Gentleman, whoſe acquaintance and friendſhip I am obliged to eſteem; and by him were tranſmitted to me with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt importunities to employ my weak Pen in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an anſwer unto them, otherwiſe I had not entred into the Liſts with this daring Enemy.</p>

               <p>Another reaſon is, becauſe the multitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written upon the ſame ſubject, and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incomparably more ſatisfaction, hath long ſince made the world to nauſeat, and yet hath not decided one controverted point; I ſuppoſe he ſpeak in relation to Proteſtant writers, and what can be the reaſon or motive that moves him to ſpeak thus contemptibly of thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, cenſuring and condemning all that hath been written by them in defence of the truth, and in oppoſition to <hi>Romiſh</hi> errours; is it an high conceit of himſelf that makes him to have a low conceit of others? thus have I known ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys revile thoſe whom they durſt not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and meer cowards rail upon thoſe whom they durſt not attempt to conquer, and it is the practice of effeminate combatants, to diſplay their courage more by invective words, then by their great deeds; I do not account my ſelf fit to be compared in the leaſt degree to any of thoſe worthies, yet for my ſelf, I do profeſs (if there be no more ſtrength in him, then that proportion which he hath manifeſted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections

               <p>To Quaere only was never accounted a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſatisfaction, nor ever known to produce that effect; if the Reflector will have it thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative, why may not a Proteſtant as eaſily and effectually demonſtrate and ſatisfy the contrary that the Religion now profeſſed by the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, is not the ſame that was firſt preached in <hi>England;</hi> ſuppoſe that the ſame <hi>Queries</hi> ſhould be ſet forth with an intimation, that they are to be reſolved in the negative; or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109869:77"/> ſuppoſe that theſe <hi>Queries</hi> ſhould be ſent forth: firſt whether the Religion profeſſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>England</hi> be the ſame which <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſed: ſecondly whether his was the ſame that was maintained by the firſt four General Councels: thirdly whether that be the ſame that was taught by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles; why ſhould not theſe <hi>Queries</hi> be as powerful to demonſtrate and ſatisfie that the Religion profeſſed by the Proteſtants is the ſame that was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as the <hi>Queries</hi> of my adverſary are to demonſtrate and ſatisfie, that the Religion now profeſſed by the Romaniſts is the ſame that was firſt preached in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſays the <hi>Reflector,</hi> had my adverſary ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains to derive the Catholick Religion through every Century, it would in all reaſon have added very much to the ſatisfaction of any diſcreet enquiring perſon; what then, this would not have demonſtrated, that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now profeſſed by the Romaniſts, is the ſame that was firſt preached in <hi>England,</hi> for there is as great a difference between that Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Religion now proteſted by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, in what it differeth from the Proteſtants, as there is between truth and errour: whether the preſent Romiſh Religion be the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the great queſtion that hangs in diſpute between the Proteſtants and the Romaniſts, which the Proteſtants do juſtly deny; and which the Romaniſts with evident proof will never be able to affirm; and it is a moſt unjuſt uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them to aſſume that Title, before a right unto it be fully proved.</p>
               <p>Had the <hi>Reflector</hi> ſaid, if my adverſary had taken the pains to derive the preſent Romiſh Religion through every Century, he would
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109869:78"/> have ſpoken ſomewhat of pertinency to the <hi>Queries,</hi> but then I would have told him that derivation would have been as great a wonder as the production of an impoſſibility; if my adverſary, or the <hi>Reflector,</hi> or any other will go to the Fountain and examine the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion by the Doctrine of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that is the Doctrine of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles delivered in the Sacred Scriptures, he will ſoon diſcover this impoſſibility; I am ſure, if it be impoſſible to derive it through the firſt Centuries, it is impoſſible to derive it through every Century.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſuppoſition that is made, the fault charged upon me is aggravated in a high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; I did but cavil (ſays the <hi>Reflector</hi>) when I ſaid that my adverſary went three miles about while a Journey of one would have been more advantageous for finding out the truth; and I might as well have ſaid that he went ſixteen miles about: but I perceive that he is like unto the Actor in the Tragedy, who was ſo deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately bent to accuſe his Enemy that he forgot what he did; while he thought to have laid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Crimes to his charge; inſtead of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication he made a repetition: By the method which the <hi>Reflector</hi> preſcribes for the reſolution of the <hi>Queries,</hi> he confeſſed that I ſaid this very thing; for if the <hi>Queries</hi> are to be reſolved by a derivation of Religion through every Century; in ſaying that my Antagoniſt went three miles about; I ſaid that he went the <hi>Reflectors</hi> ſixteen miles about, while a Journey of one would be far more ſerviceable; and this is not to cavil, but ſeriouſly and pertinently to ſpeak the truth. That Travellers may deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>But if this be the method that is to be uſed in reſolving of the <hi>Queries,</hi> how can the <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> with any ſhew of diſcretion make this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, while in the third <hi>Reflection</hi> he takes upon him to ſhew ſome reaſons, that the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> were not to be reſolved at all by Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; and how can he lay down this poſition, to ſee a Religion proved to be viſibly handled down through all Ages, ſhould be the greateſt aſſurance and ſatisfaction imaginable that it muſt be the true Religion, while he tells us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there, that muſt not be proved by them, they being in poſſeſſion the obligation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the negative lies on the Proteſtants ſide.</p>
               <p>Mark gentle Reader, the <hi>Reflector</hi> is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Riddles; what Religion is that, of which it is only queried whether it be true, yet this was to make a demonſtration, &amp; to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the truth of it? and what Religion is that, the derivation of which through every Century, would be an irreſiſtible proof of the truth of it; and yet this derivation is not to be made; and to ſee it viſibly handed down through every Age, would be the greateſt aſſurance that

               <p>Becauſe you lay this great weight upon this argument of poſſesſion, do us the right to ſuffer it to be as ſerviceable for us, as you expect it ſhould be for your ſelves; and you will find your ſelf beaten with your own weapon, and forced to confeſs that which you have peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, <hi>melior eſt conditio poſſidentis, the condition of the Poſſeſſor is beſt;</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion hath been, and is in as calm, and ſerene, and flouriſhing poſſesſion in <hi>England</hi> as ever the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion was; therefore it ought not in common reaſon to be changed or diſobeyed upon pretences, ſuppoſitions, and meer probabilities, but to be obeyed and admitted as the only true, and undoubted Religion, until the contrary be evinced and demonſtrated by moſt vigorous and manifeſt proofs; therefore it was unreaſonable to propound the <hi>Queries;</hi> and being unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably propounded, there was great reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a proof of them in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>And though you do ſuggeſt the contrary, it was not upon pretences and ſuppoſitions, and meer probabilities that the Reformers diſobeyed, and changed the Romiſh Religion, but upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and convincing proofs made of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, which was and is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Romiſh Church; the expresſion of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> might juſtly have been applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; <hi>how is the faithful City become an Harlot; it was full of judgment, righteouſneſs lodged in it, but now Murderers; thy ſilver is become droſs, thy wine mixt with water;</hi> it was high time for the Refiners to work, to purge away her droſs, and to take away her Tinn; to diſpel thoſe miſts of Romiſh errours that clouded the truth, and cryed againſt Religion, as the <hi>Edomites</hi> did againſt

               </p>
               <p>As to your report concerning <hi>Luther;</hi> firſt, I anſwer that all reports made by Romiſh Writers are not true; witneſs the untruths that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in your <hi>Prologue</hi> and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>flections;</hi> and this I know, that many things are charged upon <hi>Luther,</hi> of which he was not guilty in the leaſt meaſure; and this report which you do make here, is one of them, to charge this expresſion upon him, in that manner as you do, is a wilful and wicked ſlander; the expresſion was vented in the heat of diſputation with <hi>Eckius</hi> and his companions, whom <hi>Luther</hi> perceived to be deſperately ſettled in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the truth, they being ſtirred up by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and malice, and hired thereunto by the Pope, when <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther</hi> found that they would not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the light of the truth, but would perſiſt in a deſperate oppoſition againſt it; he ſays in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that oppoſition, <hi>non propter Deum haec res caepta eſt, nec propter Deum finietur, this work was not begun for God's ſake, nor for God's ſake will it be ended;</hi> and ſo I may ſay of you, your writing againſt me in defence of your erroneous Religion, was not begun for God's ſake, nor unleſs I had ſome better ground of hope than yet is viſible, for God's ſake will it be ended.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, ſuppoſe he had vented that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſion in that manner as you ſay, you that build your juſtification upon charity, ſhould have been ſo charitable unto him as to have taken his words in this ſence; for no other interpretation can be impoſed upon them without the breach of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, it was not by mans entreaty or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was moved to attempt the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; neither by mans entreaty or begging
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109869:88"/> would he be perſwaded to deſiſt from it; you know it was mans entreaty and begging, if the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> deſired him for Gods ſake to return to the obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhould malice make the worſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that could be made of the words, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can you reap from them? if a perſonal fault muſt be an argument againſt Religion, why do you make claim unto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to derive from him the chiefeſt Article of your Religion, to wit, the Pope's Supremacy? you know that he was guilty of a very great fault, in denying and for ſwearing his Maſter; and then give us leave to account the worſe of your Religion, becauſe Pope <hi>Hilderbrand</hi> threw the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the Fire; Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Popes, were Necromancers and Conjurers; ſeveral ſo prodigious and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Lives and Converſations, that <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> (one of your own Writers) terms them very Monſters; two of your Biſhops at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> were taken in the Act of Adultery, and the one clubbed to death, the other hanged; you will acknowledge your ſelf to have ſome perſonal Faults, unleſs you will ſay, that you ſtand not in need of the Forgiveneſs of Actual Sins, which if known, by your Logick a Deduction might be made thence, to convince you of the Erroneouſneſs and Malignity of your Religion.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader determine, whether you have made good your Poſition, that it was unreaſonable to require a Proof of the Affirmative of the Queries; you have builded very much upon the Lawyers Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109869:89"/> Poſſeſſion; therefore it will be unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unjuſt to reject his Opinion concerning the Proof of the Affirmative; and (beſides all that hath been ſaid to ſhew the Neceſſity of it) he tells you, that <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio;</hi> Affirmatives are to be proved; wherefore, it being a Duty which my Adverſary was obliged to perform, he ſhould not have been ſo careleſs and ſloathful in the Proof of his Religion, as to ſtand in need to be requeſted to do it, therefore your Charge of Severity vaniſhes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to meer Smoke, and it was juſt to aſſimilate him to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſters, becauſe he would be laying of unneceſſary Burdens upon us, and would have us to be working to prove the Negative, while he would be neglecting of his Duty.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN your Prologue you told me, that it was your purpoſe to level your few Reflexions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Method and way of anſwering, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them to the Reader, as a Rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to determine concerning my Papers, whether I had in them kept cloſe unto the Matter in controverſie, and diſcuſſed it with Reaſon; here you direct one particular Reflection againſt the very ſame Mark. It ſeems your Memory is very frail, you forgot to proſecute your purpoſe in the three firſt; but to ſupply that defect, you rub up your Memory in the fourth: I ſhall paſs by this infirmity, leaving the Reader to deſcant on it as he pleaſes, and will mind you of that which you told me in your<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prologue concerning the unprofitableneſs of Diſputation; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thence, that it was againſt your inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter into the Liſts: but here you ſay, that ſolid diſputation is a matter of greateſt importance: When will you be conſtant to your ſelf? It is not you diſtinction of ſolid and unſolid, or prudent and imprudent, that can ſalve the Contradiction; for all that hath been done concerning Points of Religion, hath not been unſolid and imprudent; and yet you ſay, all hath but made the world to nauſeate, and hath not decided one controverted point.</p>
               <p>And here I find you agreeing with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Diſputant M. <hi>H. L.</hi> in your Opinion concerning my Papers, my Method, and way of proceeding (ſay you) hath been diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unconcluſive; ſo ſays M. <hi>H. L.</hi> but he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109869:90"/> paſſes an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> for a ſufficient Proof, while you make ſome little ſhew of Reaſon for it; in anſwer to which, I will tell you a true ſtory: There were two Fencers, that quarrelling about their Valour and Skill, for a deciſion challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged one another to the Stage; where, when they met, their greateſt Quarrel was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Weapons they were to uſe; and not agreeing about this, they preſently whipt off the Stage, leaving the Spectators to gaze one upon another in a friutleſs Repentance for their miſpent Pains and Coin.</p>
               <p>I ſhall leave the Application of this to be made by your ſelf, and do appeal to your own Iudgment to determine how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pertinent your preſent Diſcourſe is, you know my impoſed Task was, the reſolution of three trivial and unprofitable Queries; will you tell me what infallible Rule, or Guide, or Judge there is to be found and uſed for the effecting of this? If there be none (as I am ſure there is none) for the determining of that which is unneceſſary to be known, why talk you of an infallible Rule, and Guide, and Judge?</p>
               <p>And why do you ſay that if I had a mind to have proceeded ſolidly in a diſputation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning points of Religion, ſuch an infallible rule or guide or Judge ſhould have been nominated, can there be a ſolid proceeding in a diſputation concerning points of Religion, when they are not points of Religion that are to be diſputed? The great concern of the Queries is the Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Non-Identity of the preſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, and of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Religion with that of the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> and of the Religion of the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> with that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109869:90"/> which was firſt brought into <hi>England?</hi> which are not points of Religion; they are not points of Religion which may be affirmed or denied without any hinderance to the Worſhip of God, and the ignorance of which cannot prejudice the health of the Soul, while man is upon the queſt of his Salvation.</p>
               <p>Your Diſcourſe here is as pertinent as that was of the Traveller, who when he ſhould have related thoſe things that concerned his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, as what Countreys he paſſed, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Soil, with the quality of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the entertainment he found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, talked of the Land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> and of the World in the Moon, and other feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Regions, that are not to be found <hi>in rerum natura:</hi> it ſeems that you were reſolved to put your Pen upon motion, though you did not matter how irregular it was, and to blind the Eyes of your obliging Friend, you would be ſaying ſomething, though it was nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But to follow you in this wild Chace, and to ſhew how much your <hi>Reflection</hi> is troubled with the Simples, as well as with Impertinency; Firſt, I will tell you, that all Diſputations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning points of <hi>Religion,</hi> that have been made between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> have been without a previous Agreement concerning an infallible Rule, Guide or Judge, therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground their diſcourſes muſt be as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and unconcluſive as mine; and <hi>ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men miſeris ſocios habuiſſe doloris;</hi> it is no ſmall comfort to me, to be ranked among thoſe Learned Proteſtant Writers, againſt whoſe convincing Reaſons you dare no more object,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109869:91"/> than a Child dares to enter into the Liſts to fight with a Man of War.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the force of your own Reaſon, you are compelled to ſhake hands with me, and to ſay Hail fellow, well met, in reflecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Papers, you have written as much concerning Points of <hi>Religion,</hi> as I have in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Queries, and you have not previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly agreed with me concerning an infallible Rule, or Guide, or Judge, therefore your whole Diſcourſe hath been diſordered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive; and pray Sir, to avoid this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in the future, do not write again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you be aſſured that we do agree about theſe things: the obſervation of this Advice will ſave you the pains and the ſhame of writing any more Impertinences and Untruths; for if you do continue in retaining your Opinions, for want of this Agreement, you may lay aſide your Pen until the laſt Day of the World doth come.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, it was my Duty to lay down ſome Principle <hi>per ſe notum,</hi> or to nominate an infallible Rule, or Guide, or Judge; if there be an infallible Rule, there is no neceſſity for an infallible Guide, or Judge; for he that guides and judges according to that infallible Rule, guideth and judgeth infallibly, though he be not infallible in himſelf; therefore I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, being there is an infallible rule, that I do not know any infallible Guide or Judge under Heaven; if you do know any, it is my deſire to be informed by you; and if you will comply to my deſire, when you lay down your Inſtructions, be ſure to obſerve your own Preſcriptions, and produce not any thing that is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109869:91"/> probable, conjectural, or uncertain, but ſome infallible Proof for them; otherwiſe (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Aſſertion) they muſt be rejected as erroneous, or at leaſt doubtful: as for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, or Principle <hi>per ſe notum,</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation lies as much upon you, or any other undertaking to write concerning Points of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> will you, or any other have your Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be received for infallible Truths upon your own bare Authority? the Reaſons for which you transfer the Duty wholly upon me, are ſo childiſh, that it is a ſhame to take noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, You have an admirable ſhort and ready way of refuting all Diſputations that ſhall be made againſt your <hi>Religion;</hi> though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do lay down never ſo many Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>per ſe nota,</hi> and tell you of the infallible rule never ſo much, yet while you do retain your own Principles, you will never agree with them about it; therefore (you will ſay) all that ſhall be objected againſt your <hi>Religion,</hi> will be diſordered and inconcluſive; and thus though your <hi>Religion</hi> be an Houſe built upon the Sand, yet (in your Conceits) it remains as firm and unmoveable as a Mountain; upon the ground of this ſhameful Defence, which you do make for it; but, good Sir, if a diſagreement about this, be of ſuch ſtrength to conclude, let it be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109869:92"/> as ſtrong in the mouth of a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as you would have it to be in the mouth of a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> and let us retort upon you and ſay, that all that ſhall be objected by you againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> will be diſordered and unconcluſive, becauſe you will not agree with us about an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Either your Ignorance is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or your Unconſcionableneſs not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd: Do you not know that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded three Queries to my Adverſary? the Affirmatives of which are as many <hi>Principia per ſe nota,</hi> undeniable Truths, though not for the determination of my Adverſaries Queries yet, by which the pretended Truth of your <hi>Religion</hi> may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be examined? And do you not know what <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do mean, when they ſpeak of an infallible Rule? Yea, have I not told you what is meant by it in that Expreſſion, <hi>viz. I do not wonder that you keep a Veil over the faces of your People to hinder them from looking into the Holy Scripture?</hi> And if you do know theſe things, why do you conceal and deny your Knowledge? Can it ſtand with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a good Conſcience to ſpeak a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Untruth?</p>
               <p>And your inconſiſtency with your ſelf is as prodigious as either, what you do expreſly deny, you do implicitely confeſs, that you do know that by the infallible rule Proteſtants do mean the Holy Scripture, becauſe you do produce ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove, that it is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, Proteſtants do maintain the Holy Scripture to be this Rule, and if
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109869:92"/> you do not know this, while you are writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Proteſtants, why do you produce Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt it? it ſeems that by the frequent uſe of contradiction, you have attracted ſuch an habit, that if you do open your mouth to ſpeak you muſt incur the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing your ignorance to be as great as you do pretend, which no rational man will believe, while you do profeſs your ſelf to be a Romaniſt; how can you conclude that I dare not ſtand to the Judgment and determination of that infallible rule, which I have ſpoken of, being aſſured that I ſhould bring a ſtaff upon mine own head, and find my religion to be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto it? can you draw concluſions from premiſes that you do not know? it is a great ſhame to uſe this kind of argument, but I have your ſelf to be my famous preſident, which will ſhield me from the imputation of folly, and bring it home to your own doors; you talk here of an infallible rule, and guide, and Judge, but you have not told me, nor do I know certainly what you mean, whether Fathers or Traditions, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or Popes, or Church, therefore you dare not ſtand to the Judgment and determination of your own infallible rule or guide or Judge, being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that you would bring a ſtaff upon your own head, and find your Religion to be diſagreeable to them; this (I confeſs) is as if I ſhould reaſon after this ſimple and contradictory manner, I know not the quality of the man, but I know that he is a dangerous man, and will do me a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, becauſe he hath not made himſelf known unto me.</p>
               <p>Becauſe you plead ignorance ſo much, I ſhall diſpell this dark miſt, and tell you that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109869:93"/> rule, I do not mean Fathers, or Counſels, or Traditions, or Church, or any thing elſe, but only the Holy Scripture, that ſacred Word of God, which was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and written by ſuch penmen as were ſpecially fitted for that Employment: this is the rule by which we walk, and by which we do prove the truth of our doctrines, and demonſtrate the erroniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the modern Romiſh Religion; and this you do know, though you have the face to deny it, ſaying, That while I ſpeak of an infallible rule: you cannot imagine what I ſhould mean, while I ſtick unto the Proteſtant Principles, for Scripture alone, ſay you, it cannot be for reaſons expreſſed before; the meaning of which is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown to me, unleſs by it, you do ſay, that when you do ſee you are ſtark blind, for you do know that this is one of the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that the Holy Scripture is the infallible rule: as for the reaſons wherewith you do labor to refute the truth of it, when they come to be examined, which will be preſently, they will be found to be lighter than vanity, in the mean time let me ask you, why you do faſten the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful term of a dead Letter upon the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and in what ſence this may be done? I cannot find by the ſtricteſt inquiſition, that (as from its ſelf) it can (in any reſpect) have this ignominious Title applied unto it, nor can I imagine how you can reconcile what you ſay to the experimented Efficacy of it, and the Doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> he proves it to be a living Letter; ſaying that <hi>it is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword,</hi> and that <hi>it is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109869:93"/> that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work;</hi> and that the reading of it hath produced theſe wholſom effects in many, is ſo abundantly confirmed by Experience, that it cannot be denied: if the Word of the ever-living God can in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect have the Title of a dead Letter applied unto it,, I would know whoſe Word it is that is the living Letter: Is it the Word of Fathers, or Traditions, or Councils, or Popes? <hi>Are</hi> Abana <hi>and</hi> Parphar, <hi>Waters of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>better than all the Waters of</hi> Iſrael? Muſt the Word of vain, mortal, fallible men be advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Word of the ever-living God? take heed of making ſuch blaſphemous Aſſertions, this is the Word that will judge you at the laſt Day; and if you do not repent for that Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy which you have wilfully and wickedly breathed out againſt it, it is not the imaginary Flames of Purgatory-fire that will procure you a tolerable Judgment,</p>
               <p>It is not your pitiful Reaſons that can diſanul the Authority of this infallible Rule; every one will laugh at the ſimplicity of your firſt Deduction: The <hi>Arrians</hi> (ſay you) quoted Scripture for the maintaining of their Hereſie, therefore it is not the infallible Rule. I will help you with another as concluſive as this; the Devil quoted Scripture to perſwade our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to caſt himſelf down from the Pinnacle of the Temple, therefore it is not the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule: Is that Authority diſanulled, which is abuſed by ſome diſobedient and unruly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Poſſibly you may be abuſed as a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt; but I ſuppoſe, you will not acknowledge, that by this that Power and Authority is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109869:94"/> which you received by Commiſſion from <hi>Rome;</hi> God is abuſed by the Sins of men, yet I hope you will not conclude thence, that his Power and Authority is diſanulled which he claims over the Sons of men: you do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the feebleneſs of this Argument, while you do affirm, that the Abuſe of a good thing ſhould not take away the Uſe of it (of which I will tell you more hereafter) and what was the <hi>Arrians</hi> impugning the Divinity of Chriſt by Scriptural Quotations, but an abuſing of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Arrians</hi> impugned the Divinity of Chriſt with far more plauſible Quotations and Texts of Scripture than I can produce for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> is an Aſſertion which I deny; and which you ought to have proved; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not done, perſwades me to believe, that you knew it to be a groſs untruth, yet you would confidently avouch it, purpoſely to deface the Authority, and vilifie the Uſe of the Holy Scripture, that you might induce your follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to believe, that the evidence it holds out, is not a ſufficient proof for the manifeſtation of Truth, and the diſcovery and confutation of Errors; and all this is done as a meer ſhift, to prevent (if it might be) the Uſe of that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting force that is in it, to be employed againſt your Religion: what will not the Conſcience of this Gentleman ſwallow? what will he not adventure to do for the defence of his errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion? while without any ſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, he can favour the <hi>Arrians,</hi> tread under his feet the Sacred Word of God, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to be a greater Patron and Defender of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Impiety, than of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Truths:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109869:94"/> it is well known, that though the <hi>Arrians</hi> quoted Scripture for their wicked Opinion, yet they were irreſiſtibly confuted by the clear evidence of Scripture; and it is as notoriouſly known, that you do reject the Holy Scripture, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be a rule for the determination of that Controverſie which is between the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and conſequently, it is eaſie to determine which of us, whether I and other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereticks can produce moſt plauſible Texts of Scripture for our Opinions; though you diſtil this falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion into the minds of your people, that we cannot find any convincing Evidence in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the proof of our Religion; yet you know very well, that the Evidence which we produce thence againſt you, compels you to fly (as ſometime the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did from the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi>) into Holes and Caves, and Thickets; I mean the Coverts of Church, Traditions, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility, and other dark Corners, to hide your ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is a certain ſign that you labour under a miſerable ſcarcity of Arguments, while the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which you do make againſt me, do put weapons into my hands, to be employed for the overthrowing of your ſelf, if you maintain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, or Councils, or Traditions, to be the infallible rule, or guide, or Judge; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick <hi>Diaſcorus</hi> cried out at the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, Ego habeo Teſtimonium ſanctorum Patrum,</hi> I have the Teſtimony of the holy Fathers on my ſide; <hi>Eutiches</hi> appealed to Tradition; <hi>ſic à pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitoribus accepi &amp; credidi,</hi> ſo have I received from my Progenitors, and ſo have I believed; the <hi>Eutichian</hi> Heretick <hi>Caroſus</hi> pleaded the

               <p>Nor is it your ſecond Reaſon that can work any thing to diſanul its Authority; it is not Scripture taken according to the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of fallible men, that is the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, but Scripture taken in its own native ſence, which in things neceſſary to be known, is plain and evident to the meaneſt ordinary capacity: He that calls not many wiſe men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, not many mighty, not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world to confound the mighty; hath not failed in the end, for which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Uſe of the holy Scripture, which is the inſtruction of thoſe whom he doth call; therefore it is ſuted to their capacity, that they may read and underſtand the things that concerns their eternal Peace; wherefore it is a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109869:95"/> moſt injurious Aſſertion which you do make, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that we cannot defend our ſelves againſt the pleas of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> without the uſe of thoſe Arguments which you do employ againſt us: while we have the benefit of this infallible Rule, we are ſufficiently enabled to deal with all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies whatſoever, that do profeſs any thing of Chriſtianity; for by its power we confound the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and you, and all other Hereticks, that do maintain Doctrines contrary to the plain and evident ſence of it; and by its ſtrength the Proteſtant Tenets are eſtabliſhed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in clearneſs as far above the Scriptural Pretences af <hi>Arrians,</hi> as Light is above Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Truth above Errour, and beyond the greateſt reſiſtance that can be made by the ſtrongeſt Champions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Where the Scripture is obſcure the ſence is not neceſſary to be known, as God doth not caſt his pearls before ſwine, ſo he doth not hide them from his children, and for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch places we willingly ſubmit unto the Wiſdom of Councels, or the Judgment of the antient Fathers, while they are conſtant to themſelves, and conſiſtent one with another, and do not give out any interpretation, that is contradictory to thoſe places that are manifeſt and plain: and while we allow ſo much unto Councels and Fathers, you have no reaſon to ſay (as you do) that we reject all Councels, and undervalue the Fathers: we muſt not advance the word of fallible Men above the word of the everliving God, leaſt we ſhould attract the guilt of blaſphemy and Idolatry; but yet our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance doth exceed that meaſure, which you do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford unto them: when the Fathers ſpeak againſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109869:96"/> you, they are but children in your account, and when the Decrees of Counſels contradict any of your Doctrines, you cry out againſt them as illegitimate; you dare not expoſe your Religion to the deciſion of the firſt four General Counſels.</p>
               <p>Your Argument is ſo remarkable for its vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I cannot yet have done with it, though it be ſufficiently confuted already, but muſt expoſe it in its formality to the view of the judicious Reader, if the Scripture be privatly interpreted and that interpretation employed to maintain errors it cannot be the infallible rule; but the Scripture is privately interpreted by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and that interpretation is employed to maintain their errors, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. certainly you did not ruminate upon the hypothetical propoſition that is included in this Syllogiſm, when will you prove the conſequence of it to be true? if ever that come to paſs, it will be miraculous, and then you will be at a very great loſs, if you do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain either Traditions, or Fathers, or Counſels to be your infallible rule, or guide, or Judg, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Fathers, Counſels, have been privately interpreted, and that interpretation employed by Hereticks to maintain their Errors, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither Traditions, nor Fathers, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels can be the infallible rule, or guide, or Judge verily the world will wonder at your dexterity in defending the cauſe of the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> while you have been vainly ſighting againſt me, you have been deſtroying them, and have caſt the greateſt ſupports, wherewith they pretend to uphold their Religion, down unto the ground.</p>
               <p>Becauſe you have blaſphemed the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, denying it to be the Infallible rule, and you confeſs, that there is a neceſſity of having ſuch a

               <p>In what Line or Leaf of my Papers was this Conceſſion made, that I cared not how much of Antiquity and Succeſſion was granted unto the preſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion? there was never any Proteſtant, that granted unto it the leaſt ſhare in Primitive and Apoſtolick Antiquity; and as for the Antiquity that was ſpoken of, it was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the time of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and his Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries the ancient <hi>Britains;</hi> nor was this ſpoken of in relation to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, but by way of ſuppoſition; my words are plain to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Are Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Conceſſions? I ſhall make one Suppoſition more here; What if I ſay, that all the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Acts performed by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, are null and void, becauſe by exalting the Pope to be the viſible Head of the Church, they have rejected Chriſt, diſclaiming him as the only head, will he take this Suppoſition to be a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But howſoever he ſhall take it, verily there is more of truth in it, than of conceſſion in the former; when he did read over my Papers, he could not but find me proving, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Brags made by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> concerning Antiquity, the Religion now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them, can claim no farther than to the little Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> if I made that Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where was the Gentleman's eyes, that he that is ſo apt and forward to accuſe me of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, could not eſpy a contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Conceſſion and that proof, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which he ſtands like the Gueſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that came to feaſt without a wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſpeechleſs; but alas, he could not help it, he would have ſpoken, if he could have found any thing to ſay.</p>
               <p>And in what Line or Leaf of my Papers is the unexpected change, which is ſo much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, and that manifeſt contradiction, which is charged upon me? is there any inconſiſtency between the forementioned Suppoſition, and the Anſwer that was made to the firſt Query? My Suppoſition (of which ſome Account hath been already given, but I am forced to trouble the Reader with another repetition) was this;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109869:98"/> if I ſhould grant you ſo long Succeſſion for your Religion, what advantage could you make of it, if you reaſon after this manner to confirm the Truth pretended to belong unto your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, my Father, and my Grandfather, and ſo onward, until you come to <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> were of this Religion, therefore it is true; a Jew or a Turk may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the ſame probability; or if you reaſon thus, Our Religion is as ancient as <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> therefore it is true; a Turk may plead as great Antiquity for his Religion, and a Jew greater for his: My Anſwer to the firſt Query was this; we may preſume that <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Religion was the ſame which his Maſter Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> profeſſed, and your Religion differs from his in theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Canon of the Scripture, the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Scripture, the Reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now what carping <hi>Momus</hi> can find occaſion to bark at theſe Expreſſions, or what ſubtil Sophiſter is there that can draw from them the Poſition charged upon me, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sum of the Controverſie, and the main Buſine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Is it poſſible for a man to write while he ſleeps? certainly if he was awake, he was more dimſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the blind man in the Goſpel, who ſaw men walking like trees; or rather did he not look upon my papers (as Aſtrologers tell us, the Planets do look ſometime upon this inferiour Orb) with a malevolent Aſpect, like the Baſilisk to kill with his ſight, but that the darting of his Venom is prevented by a careful foreſight; here is not one ſymptom of an alteration, nor any terms of contradiction to be found, which the Gentleman himſelf doth expreſly acknowledg by contradicting of himſelf, which he doth twice within a little diſtance, firſt he ſays that I grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a boundleſs antiquity to the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> yet he confeſſeth that I limited the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity ſpoken of to <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the ancient <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> Secondly, he ſpeaks boldly and poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaying, that the ſum of the Controverſie, and the main buſineſs was to find out what <hi>Religion Auſtin</hi> profeſſed, it being become the Rule of my Belief, and by which the Proteſtants Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt ſtand or fall; but in his Concluſion, he ſpeaks very timerouſly and doubtfully, and ſays, I did but ſeem to reſt upon the Judgment of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and he could hardly believe that I laid any weight upon his authority, which yet was contrary to his own knowledg, for he could not but know that (as the reſolution of the firſt query was deſigned) the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Auſtin</hi> was to be tried by thoſe opinions that were maintained by his maſter; here is a perfect imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Suſannas</hi> accuſers, convincing himſelf to be a falſe witneſs againſt me by his manifeſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109869:99"/> contradictions; I would attempt to perſwade him to leave of his practice of bringing falſe and injurious accuſations, but that I know my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would be to no purpoſe, forgeries and callumnies muſt be uſed by him, otherwiſe he will want one of thoſe rotten ſupporters, that are frequently uſed by the Romaniſts in upholding their erronious <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will tell him, that it is not upon the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> or of any other private Doctor, that the truth of the Proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion is founded, nor do we apply our ſelves to any ſuch rule for the tryal of it, it is the word of the everliving God contained in the Holy Scripture, that is our foundation and rule, which only is the infallible rule, without the direction of which none can be aſſured to find out the truth, and without conformity unto which the Religion that is practiſed, will be no more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, then the offering of Swines fleſh or the cutting of the neck of a dog, and if he will vouchſafe to look upon my papers once again he will ſee this very plain, that neither the Religion of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was mentioned for any ſuch end, but only for the determination of the quere in the negative, preſuming that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> opinions were the ſame with his maſters, this was all the weight that was laid upon Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</hi>

               <p>But becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are unwilling to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the proof of the Affirmative, and great reaſon there is for it; being it is far out of their reach, ſuppoſe ſecondly that this inſufficient proof of the negative ſhould be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their mind, to be a ſtrong demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Religion now profeſſed by them is the ſame that was brought by <hi>Auſtin</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> what uſe can be made of this? a derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>And let us obſerve here what he ſays in the concluſion; the thing in controverſie (ſays he) at preſent not being whether the aſſertions be true or falſe; but whether Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> held

               <p>Firſt, the truth of the ſuppoſition being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I perceive, he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Secondly, I ſhall let him ſee what fruit he brings forth in the behalf of his Religion, by labouring to introduce the books of <hi>Machabees</hi> into the Canon, it is not the declaration of the Church that makes the holy Scripture to be a Rule;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109869:102"/> but divine inſpiration, which gives its intrinſical rectitude, whereby it is qualified and fitted to be a rule; for a rule is not ſuch becauſe it is declared to be a rule, but becauſe of its intrinſecal rectitude which it receives from the Author, who upon that ground deſigns and appoints it to be a rule; therefore where a writing wants divine inſpiration, it would be a capital errour in the Church to declare it to be Canonical: This being prepoſed I ſhall offer this <hi>Dilemma</hi> ſo his ſerious conſideration, the books of <hi>Machabees,</hi> either had divine inſpiration, or they had it not; if they had it, it was an errour in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to hold them non-Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; which was not only his own private errour, but it is ſtrongly deducible from his expreſſions, that it was the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the whole Church; for ſure there is none of this Gentlemans Tribe will dare to ſay, that the Opinion of the pretended Head of the Church did daſh againſt the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body; if they had it not, it was an errour in the third Councel of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and in the Councel of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> to declare them to be Canonical: it is ſuppoſed now that he will not ſtand mute at the ſight of this <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> but will make choice to ſome ſide, and whichſoever is made the object of his choice, it will ſhake ſome of the greateſt Pillars that are invented for the ſupportance of the Romiſh Religion; for the one throws down the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libity of the Church and Pope, the other the infallibity of Councels.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, he ſpeaks of a Catholick tenent that was intended to be aſſented unto and approved by Proteſtant Divines, but his meaning lies in the clouds, and truly I have wearied my ſelf in gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what it ſhould be; if it be that which he hath undertaken to prove here, <hi>viz.</hi> that though in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s opinion the books of <hi>Machabees</hi> were Apocriphal, yet now they are to be received as Canonical: It is a moſt injurious and falſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for all proteſtants have unanimouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary: if he means that tenet, which he ſays is expreſly held and defended, not only by Doctor <hi>Bilſon,</hi> but alſo by divers of the chief Proteſtant Divines, to wit, that this moſt weighty controverſy of diſcerning true Scripture from falſe, cannot otherwiſe be decided, but by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods Church, I ſuppoſe he underſtands the Church repreſentative, otherwiſe I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his meaning, while he ſays, that the Church having determined the controverſy concerning the books of <hi>Machabees,</hi> all parties are obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto it; it is moſt injuriouſly done to report any Proteſtant writers to be Patroons of this moſt groſs untruth; what did not the general practice of the Primitive Church, planted and watered by the Apoſtles, and their immediate Succeſſors, and the opinion of the Fathers, which lived next after them, ſerve effectually for the deciding of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and diſcerning of true Scriptures from
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109869:103"/> falſe? Did the Apoſtles (as without queſtion they did) after the writing of the Holy Scriptures, propound them as a Canon to the Church, and while the original copyes were extant, did the <hi>Apoſtle John</hi> collect and conſign a Canon for the Church, as is proved by the concurrent ſuffrage of antiquity, and was not this tranſmitted to poſterity? did not the Church of God know what Scriptures were Canonical for the ſpace of three hundred years after Chriſt, during which time there was not any general Councel to determine this controverſy? and what perſpectives doth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councel uſe, that the Primitive Chriſtians and Fathers had not the ſame glaſs to look through for the diſcerning of true Scriptures from falſe, that Religion is very indigent of ſupports, that ſtands in need to be ſuſtained by thoſe ſlanderous reports, that are the Parents of many irrational and ſenceleſs concluſions.</p>
               <p>If he had ſaid that Dr. <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant writers do affirm that a general Councel hath authority to enquire concerning every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted part of Scripture, and to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the evidence that it hath on its ſide can afford ſufficient inducement, to believe that it can have no other derivation, but from the Fountain of truth, and accordingly to declare and propound their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be embraced by the Church, I ſhould have eaſily aſſented to the truth of it; but this is nothing ſerviceable for him, but altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and deſtructive unto his preſent deſign; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition hath been made concerning the books of <hi>Machabees,</hi> and upon examination they have been found ſo defective in evidence, that they have been judged to be meerly the iſſue of mans invention, therefore they have been determined and declared
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109869:103"/> to be Apocriphal, and that determination and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration being agreeable unto truth, there is no general Councel, can have authority to determine and declare the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, I will tell him that the books of <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> were not only doubted of by ſome particular Churches and Perſons, but rejected as Apocriphal by the Pope (who is pretended to be the head of the Church) declaring not only his own private o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but alſo the opinion of the whole Church, and they were doubted of and rejected not only for ſome ſhort time, but for many ages upon juſt and undeniable grounds, they being originally not in Hebrew, but in Greek, and the Jewiſh Church, to whom (as the Apoſtle tells us) were committed the the Oracles of God, never received them into the Canon, beſides the ſtile of them is ſo low and unlike the ſtile of the holy Scriptures; that it is a diſgrace unto the ſpirit of God, to affirm them to he his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates; they contain likewiſe ſeveral matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, to thoſe books, that were never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by any in the Church; nor did our Saviour or any of his Apoſtles give teſtimony unto them, by quoting any part of them, as they did to ſeveral books of the old Teſtament: now muſt he prove that the books of the new teſtament mentioned by him; were not only doubted of, but rejected by the whole Church for ſeveral ages upon as juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable grounds, otherwiſe the members of his compariſon are as unequal and lame, as the legs of <hi>Mephibozeth</hi> were, and his argument grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as ridiculous and unconcluſive as that of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who becauſe there is but one King in an hive of Bees, concluded that there was to be but one viſible Monarch in the Church: he muſt not think to paſs that coin, that is proved to be counterſeited by wanting purity of Mettal, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109869:104"/> the Kings impreſſion for current money, as well as that which is proved to have both, though it be q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſtioned by ſome unskilful perſons, that want underſtanding to diſtinguiſh between the good coin and the counterfeit.</p>
               <p>I dare refer it to his own judgment, to determine whether there was as much reaſon for the rejecting of the books of the new Teſtament, that were doubted of but for a ſhort time, by ſome particular Churches and Perſons; as there is for the rejecting of the books of <hi>Machabees,</hi> that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages after their firſt exiſtence in the world, were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Canonical by any part of the Church, and then whether it was rationally and juſtly done by the Councels of <hi>Carthage, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> to decree contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Primitive Church and Fathers, and contrary to the Councel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which declared them to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriphal, and to the Councel of <hi>Trullo;</hi> which approved of and confirmed the decrees of the Councel of <hi>Laodicia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, let it be obſerved once more how conſiſtent he is with himſelf, here he labours tooth and nail to bring the books of <hi>Machabees</hi> into the Canon, which (if I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the word Canon doth import) is to joyn them to the Holy Scriptures in being a rule; and in his fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, with one wipe of his Pen he daſhes out the whole Scripture from being a rule, by denying it to be a compleat and infallible rule, for if it be a rule, it is propounded by God unto his people, who can propound a rule of faith and manners to direct them in the way of Salvation, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? and if it be propounded by God as a rule, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and infallible, I hope he will not face Heaven and ſay that God hath deceived his people by propounding to them an imperfect and fallible rule, therefore to deny it to be compleat and infallible, is to deny it to be a rule.</p>
               <p>He thanks God that he is not a profeſſor of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, but by this how blaſphemouſly he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to be the author of thoſe deluſions, that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and owned by him, I leave to the judgment of any rational and pious perſon; if inſtead of thanking God for this, he had prayed to God, that he would have given him grace to open his eyes to ſee and acknowledg thoſe truths that are profeſſed by Proteſtants he would not have been leaſt to himſelf, to uſe ſuch ſhameful contradictions, and ſuch pittiful arguments, as he hath uſed in defence of that cauſe which he undertakes to manage and maintain againſt me.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Sufficiency of the Scriptures.</head>
               <p>IN his Fourth Reflection, he denies the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the infallible Rule, and faſtens the Title of a dead Letter upon it: Here, being dazled with the Light of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s expreſſion, he is not aſhamed to make a Recantation, confeſſing the truth, and bringing with him the witneſs of <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lyrinenſis</hi> to confirm it; ſaying, that the Canon of the Scripture is perfect, and in all points very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in it ſelf: that cannot in any reſpect be rotten, which is altogether ſound; the Scripture cannot in any reſpect (as from it ſelf) be termed a Dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it be perfect, and in all points very ſufficient in it ſelf; and if it be ſuch, it alone muſt be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule.</p>
               <p>And it is ſtrange that he did not underſtand how Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s expreſſion (the truth of which is acknowledged by himſelf, and confirmed by <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lyrinenſis</hi>) ſhould be evidently contradictory unto the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church decreed in the Council of <hi>Trent, (Concil.

               <p>It is not his diſtinction between the ſufficiency of the Scripture in it ſelf, and its ſufficiency to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret its ſelf, nor the inference of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> that can reconcile theſe Contradictions; for firſt, though the holy Scriptures be myſterious and dark in many places, yet in all things neceſſary to be known for inſtruction and edification, they are plain to every ordinary capacity. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, that the holy Scriptures are an Epiſtle ſent by God from Heaven unto his Creature upon Earth; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God would not lap up his mind concerning things neceſſary to be known, in ſuch myſterious and dark Expreſſions that his Creatures could not attain to the knowledge of it; this in effect would be not to ſend any Epiſtle at all: for I do not apprehend any great difference between denying to ſet Meat upon the Table, and ſetting hard bare Bones inſtead of Meat.

               <p>Secondly, I do not find that <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> affirmed that the holy Scripture in every part and parcel thereof is myſterious and dark; nor could this be affirmed by any man with any colour of truth: but it muſt be acknowledged by all, that as many places are myſterious and dark, ſo many more are manifeſt and plain; wherefore his words are to be taken as ſpoken in relation to thoſe places that are myſterious and dark; and he doth not infer from the myſteriouſneſs and darkneſs of thoſe places a neceſſity of the Eccleſiaſtical underſtanding, but that the Line of Prophetical and Apoſtolical Expoſition be directed according to the rule of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Underſtanding; that is, that the myſterious and dark places of the Prophets and Apoſtles be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted according to that Rule which is to be uſed by the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding in interpreting ſuch places. I do not ſay that the meaning of thoſe places is neceſſary to be known; but that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them may be known, it is neceſſary that they be interpreted according to that Rule. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it that <hi>Eunomius</hi> did interpret the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures one way, <hi>Sabellius</hi> another way, <hi>Donatus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, and the reſt of the Hereticks other ways? It was not becauſe of the myſteriouſneſs and darkneſs of them, but becauſe they did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them according to this Rule, but according to their own Fancies; and all others, interpreting the myſterious and dark places of Scripture after the ſame manner, will be ſure to faulter in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and fall upon an erronious ſence. Hence it is that <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> concludes, that the Line of Prophetical and Apoſtolical Expoſition is to be
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109869:107"/> directed according to the Rule of the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding; but not a neceſſity of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Underſtanding. If the holy Scriptures be in all things neceſſary, manifeſt and plain, it is but a weak inference, to conclude from the myſteriouſneſs and darkneſs of ſome or many places, the neceſſity of the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding. If the holy Scriptures be in all things neceſſary, manifeſt and plain, the meaning of the dark places is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known; and then where is the neceſſity of the Eccleſiaſtieal Underſtanding?</p>
               <p>And it is as deceitfully demanded how we may come rightly to underſtand the holy Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſtaking the true ſence, there being many things in them ſo deep and myſterious, that they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend all Humane Reaſon? It is a meer fallacy, from the deepneſs and myſteriouſneſs of many things, to conclude a difficulty in underſtanding all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures. Though many places are hard to be underſtood, yet there are many moſt eaſie and plain to any ordinary capacity. And though he doth cloſe his own Eyes, and will not ſee, yet he muſt give us leave to open our Eyes to ſee and to underſtand thoſe places that are manifeſt and plain.</p>
               <p>And the holy Scriptures being manifeſt and plain in all things neceſſary to be known. they are the beſt Interpreters of themſelves, and ſufficient to interpret themſelves; that is, they are the beſt Rule to walk by, in interpreting thoſe places that are myſterious and dark, and ſufficient to regulate that interpretation for the preventing of Errours and Hereſies; and that is the Rule that <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> ſpeaks of, as is evident from his own words, (<hi>Vinc. Lyr.</hi> c. 41.) he tells us that the Canon of the Scripture alone is ſufficient for all things, <hi>Non quia</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturarum
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109869:107"/> Canon ſolus ſibi non ſufficiat ad univerſa, &amp;c.</hi> If it be ſufficient for all things, it is ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the Interpretation of it ſelf. But to clear this farther, let us obſerve what the Reflector ſays; he interprets the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding to be the Churches ſenſe and Fathers interpretation of Scripture; (here he reckons the Fathers as Gyants, ranking them cloſe by the ſide of the Church; though treating of the Communion in both kinds he counts them all Pigmies;) and he may obſerve that <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> doth not ſay that the Line of Prophetical and Apoſtolical Expoſition is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected according to the Churches ſenſe and Fathers interpretation, but according to the Rule of it: He ſpeaks of theſe things as different, and ſo they are; the ſenſe of the Church, and the interpretation of the Fathers is one thing, and the Rule of this Senſe and Interpretation is another thing; the Churches ſenſe and Fathers interpretation cannot be a rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf. Now what this Rule is, hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already; it is onely the holy Scripture in thoſe places that are manifeſt and plain. How can we know whether the interpretation of the dark pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be agreeable unto the Truth, unleſs we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that interpretation with places that are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and plain? Muſt we take any Interpretation to be infallible becauſe of an <hi>ipſe dixit?</hi> Muſt the ſenſe of the Church or the Fathers interpretation be received for infallible, becauſe ſhe or they do (if they ſhould) ſay it is infallible? The claim of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility upon an <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> belongs onely unto God; and we muſt not take that for ſound Doctrine, which is contradictory or diſagreeable to thoſe places that are manifeſt and plain.</p>
               <p>To put this matter quite out of doubt, I ask the Reflector, Whether is likeſt to be true, to ſay that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:109869:108"/> the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding is a Rule unto the Scripture; or to ſay that the Scripture in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are manifeſt and plain, is a rule unto the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Underſtanding: which is as much as to ſay, whether it is the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding that directeth God how to ſpeak unto his people, or it is God that directeth the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding how to ſpeak and to interpret. Surely he will not ſay that the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding directs God how to ſpeak unto his people; then let him acknowledge that the Scripture in thoſe places that are manifeſt and plain is a rule unto the Eccleſiaſtical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and it is God that in thoſe places directeth the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding how to ſpeak and to interpret.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Gods holy Word is his Law and Rule, which he hath preſcribed unto us; and though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives very hard meaſure at the hands of the Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, whereſoever he meets with it, yet for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſake he ſhould not be ſo deſperately bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as to deny it that perfection and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which he muſt allow unto Humane Conſtitutions. Now ſuppoſe a Statute, or Clauſe of a Statute, be obſcure and dark, who muſt interpret it? He will ſay, the Judges. Well; but how muſt that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made? Muſt it be according to Law, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, or according to their own private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions? He will not ſay, contrary to the Law, nor can he ſay, according to their own private opinions, unleſs he will maintain the breaſt and will of the Judges to be Law; and then he muſt ſay, that it muſt be made according to the Law: Poſſibly one Statute may be clearer than another, and one Clauſe may afford light unto another; but howſoever, the interpretation muſt not be made in oppoſition to the Law, but to run as adequate and neer unto that Line
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109869:108"/> as poſſibly it can. The Law then muſt ſtill be the Rule of interpretation; and I would have him for Gods ſake to yield the ſame perfection and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the holy Scriptures: but what need I to beg this at his hands, while the force of <hi>Vincentius</hi>'s words, acknowledged by him to be true, hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it already? <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſays, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are ſufficient in themſelves. From this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable poſition muſt iſſue this Concluſion, That they are ſufficient to regulate the interpretation of themſelves; for certainly that ſelf-ſufficiency was not given to be lapped up in a Napkin, or covered under a Buſhel, but to ſhew it ſelf to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Reader.</p>
               <p>If the Fathers might paſs in any account with this Gentleman, I could produce the teſtimony of many on my ſide. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, (Aug. <hi>cont. litt. petil. l. 3. c. 6.)

               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:109869:109"/>
               <p>By this time it appears plainly, that the flaſh which the Reflector made, ſaying, that he did not underſtand how the Doctrine of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> concerning the ſufficiency of the Scripture, ſhould be contrary to the Doctrine of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, was but like unto the glittering of a Glo-worm, viſible to him that is in darkneſs, but diſappearing upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the light. It is evident that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are plain and eaſie to be underſtood in all things neceſſary to be known: and to know the meaning of the myſterious and dark places, thoſe Texts that are plain and eaſie to be underſtood are the beſt rule for Interpretation; ſo that the holy Scriptures need not to be beholding to Councils, or Churches, or Fathers, or Traditions, in borrowing any ſufficiency from them. Nor have they any to lend, but whatſoever is delivered by way of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation or otherwiſe, is to be examined by the rule of the holy Scriptures. And this being the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> that all things neceſſary to be known for Inſtruction and Edification are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures; and the Doctrine of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church being this, That the holy Scriptures without Traditions are neither ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor ſufficient: Unleſs ſome dark M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What is objected concerning the perverting and wreſting of the holy Scriptures made by Hereticks, is as truly applicable to the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: For the ſame fate hath befallen it; ſo that it lies open to the force of the ſame inference which the Reflector doth deduce thence. It is well known that the Fathers have been claimed and quoted by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:109869:110"/> Hereticks; and if by the ſenſe of the Church the Decrees of Councils are to be underſtood, Hereticks have pretended and appealed unto them, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed; Councils as well as Fathers have been perverted by Hereticks; and the truth is, nothing can be delivered ſo plainly, but it may be perverted, where there is a will and a purpoſe to do it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perverſion of the ſence of the Scriptures made by Hereticks, can no more prove a neceſſity of the Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding to interpret them, than it can prove a neceſſity of interpreting the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Underſtanding, and a neceſſity of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting that Interpretation; and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ask this Gentleman, whether God could not, or would not ſpeak as intelligibly and plainly as any Eccleſiaſtical Underſtanding? To ſay that he could not, is to deny his Wiſdom; and to ſay that he would not, is to deny his Goodneſs. Will he ſay that God purpoſed for to delude his people, when he inſpired thoſe ſacred Penmen that were employed to write the holy Scriptures, that inſtead of Bread, he would give his people a Stone; and inſtead of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bright ſhining Light, he would involve them in a thick Cloud, to cauſe them to grope out their way in the dark? I entertain ſuch an opinion of him, as to think that he will not affirm any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>I demand farther, if the holy Scriptures be not plain and intelligible of themſelves in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, but there is a neceſſity for the Churches ſenſe to interpret them, why is not the work done? Is there a Talent given to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved, and muſt it be lap'd up in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and lie buried in the Earth? Why are the common people hindred from the enjoyment of that benefit which the Church can afford? Why are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109869:110"/> not the holy Scriptures, with the Churches ſenſe of them, delivered unto the common people, to be read by them, that they may know the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their eternal peace? I doubt he will be hard puzzled to anſwer theſe Queſtions, unleſs he tells us, that the Churches ſenſe lies hid in the boſom of the Pariſh-prieſt, unto whom the people have liberty to apply themſelves at pleaſure, to enquire what they muſt do, and what they muſt believe; and what he ſays muſt be taken for ſound Doctrine, though it be quite contrary: Thus, though (according to the Doctrine of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>) the holy Scriptures do contain all things neceſſary for inſtruction and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet the word of a Romiſh Prieſt, and it may be one that is not able to draw a rational concluſion from apt and fit premiſes, muſt be preferred before the word of the ever-living God; and what is this but the blind leading the blind, whoſe end will be to fall both together into the Ditch?</p>
               <p>Theſe things being conſidered, it will be his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to obſerve this advice, to acknowledge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of <hi>Gregory, Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> that God in the holy Scriptures hath delivered intelligibly and plainly all things neceſſary to be known; therefore there is no abſolute neceſſity for private or publick interpretation, but all that is needful to be done, is to open the Eyes to ſee, and the Heart to receive, and to order the Will to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thoſe truths that God hath delivered plainly in the holy Scriptures.</p>

I am ſure that the unlearned want inſtruction and direction more than the learned do; and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the learned may wreſt the Scriptures to an erronious ſence, as well as the unlearned, and whoſe perverting of the Scripture is moſt deſtructive, let the Reflector determine. Who were the authors of thoſe numerous Hereſies that have infeſted the Church of God? not the unlearned, but the learned; and ſure he will grant thoſe Hereticks wreſted the Scriptures to maintain their erronious Opinions.</p>
               <p>He may find that Pope <hi>Gregory (Greg. epiſ. l. 9. epiſ.</hi> 75.) did not onely exhort <hi>Theodorus</hi> who was a Scholar, but ſuch as he ſpeaks of very contemptably here, illiterate women, to the reading of the holy Scriptures: and there was great reaſon that he ſhould do ſo, being that the holy Scriptures (as he ſays) are an Epiſtle ſent unto the Creature; which general term doth include both learned and unlearned. It had been ſtrange if with the Epiſtle he had not given unto all a commiſſion for the reading of it: muſt God beg leave of man, that his creature may know his mind? and ſhall he write an Epiſtle, and muſt it not be opened without a licenſe from the Biſhop or Inquiſitour?</p>
               <p>He tells me that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not perſwaded to read the Scriptures that he might make himſelf Judge of Controverſies; but what his meaning
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109869:112"/> ſhould be, I am very doubtful, this expreſſion being ſubject unto a different underſtanding: it is one thing for a man to aſſume the power of Judging and Determining for others; another thing for a man to uſe the liberty of Judging and diſcerning for himſelf. If his meaning be this, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not perſwaded to read the Scriptures that he might aſſume the power of propounding his Opinion au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively in matters of Controverſie to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by others, it is willingly granted. But then if he ſhall ſay that Proteſtants are perſwaded to read the Scriptures for that end, it is a moſt injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; our people are not perſwaded to read the Scriptures for any ſuch end; but in caſes of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie they have Governours and Rulers to whom they are to apply themſelves, and to them they are exhorted to ſubject themſelves by a ready and willing ſubmiſſion unto their determinations.</p>
               <p>If his meaning be this, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to read the Scriptures to judge and diſcern for himſelf, it is denyed: doth he think that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> perſwaded <hi>Theodorus</hi> to ſhut his own Eyes, and to deny the exerciſe of his own Reaſon? to what purpoſe hath God made Man a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and given him underſtanding, if he muſt not uſe it? muſt he not ſee with his own eyes, and diſcern with his own underſtanding between Right and Wrong, Truth and Falſhood? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to judge of the Doctrine which he delivered unto them, 1 <hi>Epiſt. ad Cor. c. 11. v. 3.

               <p>And as the Roman Leaders do put out the Eyes of their ignorant Followers, ſo this Gentleman endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to put out the Eyes of all others, or elſe would perſwade them to believe that they do ſee that which they cannot ſee: All their common People are ſtrictly forbidden to read the Holy Scriptures. How is it then the conſtant practice of the Roman Church, to perſwade them that are diſcreet to read the Holy Scriptures for devotion and encouragement in the Service of God? To reconcile theſe things, will he ſay, that all the common People do want Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that is, are meer fools? And he ſays, the Eccleſiaſtical underſtanding is to expound Scriptures: How then have the common People the Scriptures expounded and fitted much better by learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors in their Books almoſt of any ſort? Where are thoſe Books almoſt of any ſort, which do contain the Churches ſence upon the Scriptures? It muſt be a bad Cauſe that is managed and defended with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory ſtories as theſe.</p>
               <p>The common People which (he ſays) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to read the Holy Scriptures for Devotion, and encouragement in the Service of God, are ſome Phantaſma's, that are exiſting onely in his own brain:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109869:113"/> for there are no ſuch common People to be found in the boſome of the Romiſh Church. And the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors which he ſpeaks of, are ſome ſuch imaginary Entities, or elſe he muſt ſay, that the Jeſus Pſalter, or the Ladies Pſalter, or the Expoſition of the Maſs, or the Legend of Saints, or ſome ſuch ſuperſtitious and idolatrous Books as theſe, are thoſe learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors: for theſe, or ſome ſuch, are all the learned Expoſitors that are to be found among their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People.

Such Hiſtories as theſe (I confeſs) are frequently and plentifully to be found among their common People; the reading of which, is allowed for the paſſing away of time, and approved far above the reading of the Holy Scriptures: ſo careful and provident the Romiſh Leaders are for the Souls of their poor hood winked and deluded People.</p>

I would not be underſtood to undervalue the elaborate Tracts that have dropped from the Pens of learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109869:113"/> where Scriptures are obſcure, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Expoſition for him that deſires to know the right ſence: for which end, learned Expoſitors are highly ſerviceable. But I muſt tell him, that the ſence of thoſe places is not neceſſary to be known; in all things that are neceſſary to be known, the Scriptures are as plain as any learned Expoſitor can make them: which himſelf muſt acknowledge, or elſe he muſt ſay, that God could not, or would not ſpeak as plainly and intelligibly as any learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor can.</p>
               <p>He makes a tragical Exclamation againſt the uſe of the Holy Scriptures; but he bites his own Tongue for it, and very wiſely retracts his detracting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: for this is the ſence of his <hi>Yea rather,</hi> if any ſence can be made of it; It was my great folly to ſpeak unadviſedly; my Tongue hath uttered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things againſt the Holy Scriptures, they cannot be too much toſſed and read; nor is it the toſſing and reading of them that is productive of lamentable effects, but onely the abuſe of them: And this being the ſence of his <hi>Yea rather,</hi> alas for the reaſon of that man, that concludes againſt the uſe of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, with an Argument taken from the abuſe of them. He hath forgotten what he ſaid in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to the Reflections, there he will not decry Controverſies for the abuſe of them; but here he will decry the reading of the Holy Scriptures for that very cauſe. I perceive that he would ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be as able an Artiſt as the Shoomaker is, that can make of the ſame Leather a ſhoe to fit any foot; or as the Taylor is, that can make of the ſame Cloath a ſtockin to fit any leg, either the right or the left: he can make the abuſe of a thing to fit for any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

               <p>And alas for the Conſcience of that man, that, to maintain an erronious Opinion, and to bring an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium upon a Religious Duty, which is the reading of the Holy Scripture, fears not to ſpeak a notorious Untruth, manifeſt to the eye of every Chriſtian that will caſt his eye upon it; there is not any girl no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If there be any perſons that in the leaſt meaſure do abuſe the Holy Scriptures, they are not indulged by Proteſtants in this practice, but ſharply reproved for it; and from the abuſe of the Scriptures, he cannot conclude againſt the uſe of them: He will betray a very ſoft place in his head, if, becauſe Meat is ſometime abuſed to Gluttony, and Drink unto Drunkenneſs, he ſhall therefore conclude that neither Meat nor Drink is to

               <p>Alas for the lamentable effects of the injurious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Holy Scriptures from the common People! the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs: And the Pſalmiſt tells us, that the Law of God is perfect, converting the Soul, and inlightning the Eyes, and refreſhing the Heart: contrary cauſes do produce contrary effects. Alas then, that for want of the Holy Scriptures, the common people ſhould want Converſion, and Illumination, and Reproof, and Conſolation. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays (Chryſ. <hi>hom. 9. in Epiſt. ad Col.) Hoc omnium malorum cauſa eſt, quod Scripturae ignorantur:</hi> This is the cauſe of all Evil, that the Scriptures are not known.

               <p>Alas, that the common People ſhould pray to Saints and Angels, that they ſhould not worſhip God without the uſe of Pictures and Images, but ſhould worſhip him in and by them, and worſhip Pictures

But, to anſwer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh inference:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He may as rationally and probably conclude, becauſe ſome men are rich in the world, and ſome Kings, therefore all the men in the world are ſuch; as he can infer, becauſe ſome parts and books of Scripture are hard to be underſtood, therefore the whole Scripture is ſo: St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> do ſay, and ſo ſay I, and ſo will every one do that is not ſottiſhly ignorant, or blinded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that as there are ſome Books and Texts that are hard to be underſtood, ſo there are ſeveral Books and Texts that are plain and eaſie to every ordinary capacity, and whatſoever is neceſſary to be known is fully contained in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the difficulty of underſtanding a particular book or Text of Scripture, be a reaſon why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are not indifferently to be read by all, it is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove that it is not to be read by any; for if none muſt read the Scriptures, but ſuch as do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand every particular book and Text, there is not any learned man in the world that muſt read them, becauſe there is not any learned man in the world that doth underſtand every particular book and Text of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall offer to his conſideration an inference that doth fully and firmly conclude the contrary, as himſelf will acknowledge, unleſs he be poſſeſſed with a wonderful prejudice againſt the Truth: as the Books of <hi>Canticles</hi> and <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and other Texts of Scripture are hard to be underſtood; ſo there are many other books and Texts of Scripture that are
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109869:116"/> plain to any ordinary capacity: therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were ordained indifferently to be read by all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In them (as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith) there are Ebb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> waters where the Lamb may wade, as well as deep waters where the Elephant may ſwim. In them (as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith) is Milk for Babes to ſuck, as well as Meat for ſtrong men to eat. The unlearned will find in them matter of inſtruction to beget and increaſe Knowledge, as well as the learned, matter of ſcrutiny, to exerciſe their Wit and Induſtry, to find out the meaning of obſcure places.</p>
               <p>If there be ſuch a diſmal number of falſe Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corruptions of Scriptures, threatning no leſs than the ruine both of Church and State, as is pretended, why doth he ſuffer his Pen to lurk away under this Cloud of generals?

The Tranſlations that are common in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are not many, nor are they different in any matter of importance; which have been diligently penned, reviſed, and approved by as learned Doctors
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109869:116"/> as any the world can afford, who were employed by Authority; and laying aſide all ſiniſter reſpects, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly at the Glory of God, and the Good of his Church. And I leave it to any man of common ſence to determine whether is ſafer for the common People to rely upon ſuch Tranſlations for inſtruction in matters of Faith and Manners, or to rely upon the inſtructions of the Prieſt, and the Dictates of the Pope with his Conclave, declaring for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ends, matters to be believed and practiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>His Objection of corrupting, and adulterating, and miſtaking the ſence of the Scriptures, is ſo ſilly, that a meer Novice that hath not yet learned the Principles of the Romiſh Religion, would be aſhamed to expoſe it to the publick view: Upon the ſame ground let not any Romiſh Prieſt, nor the Pope and his Conclave, nor the Repreſentative Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any thing to the common People: for the ſence of their plaineſt Declarations is as much ſubject to corruption, and adulterating, and miſtaking, as the ſence of the Scripture is.

               <p>And I perceive that he harps ſtill upon the ſame ſtring, though he doth make very harſh Muſick. What is falſifying and corrupting Tranſlations, and what is corrupting, and adulterating, and miſtaking the ſence of the Scripture, but an abuſing of the Scripture? And what a pitiful Argument this is to conclude againſt the uſe of it, hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109869:117"/> What if there were twenty corrupt and falſe Tranſlations, would it therefore follow that there is none true, or that the true Tranſlations are not indifferently to be read by all? And what though the ſence of the Scripture in ſome places be ſubject to be miſtaken and adulterated, and that by come ill-diſpoſed perſons; doth he certainly know the Capacity of all the common People, that he dare conclude, that there is none amongſt them that can make a good uſe of the Scripture, &amp; take it in a right ſence? Hath God by his ſpecial Providence appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the penning, and preſerved the being of the Scripture for his People, and will his Providence now fail in providing a true and pure Tranſlation? And hath he promiſed the guidance of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to lead his People into all Truth, and will that Spirit ſuffer them to pervert the Scriptures to their own deſtruction? Let not any one be ſo wicked as to think that God will not perform his promiſe, and make all neceſſary proviſion that is fit for his People; and then let not any one dare to ſay, that there is danger in reading of the Scriptures, leſt the People of God ſhould fall upon a falſe and corrupt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſhould miſtake the ſence of it, and pervert it to their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>If St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had ſeen never ſo many falſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, he would not have concluded as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman doth, but have taken care to furniſh the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to his charge with a true Tranſlation, and would have taught them how to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Coin and the Counterfeit. He quotes St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in ſpeaking (as he pretends againſt the reading of the Scriptures, how pertinently, ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be ſhewed;) but he doth not obſerve how he exhorts Chriſtians to the reading of the Scripture, not fearing the danger of falling upon a corrupt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109869:117"/> Tranſlation: <hi>Non ſolum,</hi> ſays he, (<hi>Aug. in cap. Jeju.) ſufficiat quod in Eccleſiâ Divinas lectiones auditis, ſed diam in domibus veſtris aut ipſi legite, aut alios legentes requirite:</hi> Think it not ſufficient that ye hear the Scriptures in the Church; but alſo in your houſes at home either read your ſelves, or get ſome others to read unto you. And he tells us, that there were many Tranſlations in his days, and teſtifies their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, by ſhewing the happy Fruit that ſprung from the uſe of them: <hi>Scriptura Divina,</hi> ſays he, (<hi>Aug. de Doct. Chriſt. l. 2. c. 5.) ab una Lingua pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta per varias interpretum linguas, longe lateque diffuſa innotuit gentibus ad ſalutem:</hi> The Holy Scriptures paſſing from one Tongue, and being publiſhed abroad far and wide by ſundry Tongues of Interpreters, have come to the knowledge of Nations to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If there were many Tranſlations in his days, and not any of them corrupted, how comes it to paſs that there is ſuch variety of corrupt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in theſe days, as is affirmed by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Doth Gods Providence fail now in relation to his People? and are all the Rulers of the Church in a deep ſleep, while there is none but this vigilant Gentleman with his Romiſh Brethren, awake to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Expreſſion makes nothing for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for he doth not ſay, that the reading of the Holy Scriptures is the Spring of Hereſies, but the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of them: Nor is this all the original that he ſpeaks of, but he tells us, that this miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be confidently avouched and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; which is a fault more incident unto the Learned than the Unlearned. There is no rational man will think that an unlearned perſon wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, can or will as confidently avouch and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his miſunderſtandings, as the learned who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109869:118"/> themſelves to be able to make out any poſition, though it be never ſo much contradictory unto truth. But however, if ſome ill-diſpoſed perſons (like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spider) ſhould ſuck Poyſon by abuſing this Roſe; yet let him acknowledge that the well-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and humble (like unto the induſtrious Bee) do gather Honey from it. Now it appears plainly to the Reader, that the great Thunder-crack that he made, crying out alas for the inconveniencies of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, was nothing but a great blaſt of Wind without any Bolt to hurt, or hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people from reading of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But I perceive that he is reſolved to have the good hap to fall upon Truth ſometime: For though Contradictions cannot be both true, yet it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that they ſhould be always both falſe. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and denies the very ſame thing; a little before he told us, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> did not allow of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and Popular reading of the Scripture, only he exhorted <hi>Theodorus</hi> who was a Scholar: and it is the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to exhort thoſe that are diſcreet, but to reſtrain Girls, and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick Women, and Artificers; and he gives this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, The difficulty of underſtanding Scriptures by thoſe that are learned, is ſufficient to convince a rational man, that they were not indifferently to be read by all. Here he ſays, that though Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> words do make nothing for a Licentious and Popular reading of the Scriptures, as it is uſed now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, to intermeddle and judge of matters of Faith; yet they make for this kind of reading, to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and judge for inſtruction of life and manners; and this very allowance is made by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange that he ſhould be ſuch a refractory ſon to his holy Mother the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prove that is not to be done, which (as he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109869:118"/> ſays) ſhe doth freely allow: And how can I make theſe things to hang together? that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth allow the common people to read the Scriptures for inſtruction in life and manners; and yet the Scriptures are not indifferently to be read by all, becauſe of the variety of corrupt and falſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, and the difficulty of underſtanding them; and becauſe the ſence of them is ſubject to be corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, miſtaken and adulterated?</p>
               <p>But why muſt this Licentious and Popular reading of the Scriptures, to intermeddle and judge for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of life and manners be allowed, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for inſtruction in points of Faith? Is it becauſe the holy Scriptures are more intelligible, or the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding more apprehenſive in matters of life and manners? Or is it becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not much regard how the Life and manners of the common people are ordered, ſhe being an excellent Phyſician, having a ready Cure for every Diſtemper that is made known by auricular Confeſſion? Or is it becauſe ſhe dares not truſt God for inſtruction in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, as well as in matters of Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? I would enquire concerning the validity and truth of theſe Reaſons, becauſe ſome of them are of a ſtrong influence; but that there is another thing that carries the preheminence above all, that which wrought upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-ſmith, cauſing him to cry out, <hi>Sirs, ye know that by this Craft we have our wealth.</hi> Whatſoever the rule be that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the life and manners of the people, their Faith muſt be pinned upon the Prieſts or the Popes ſleeve; this is the Harveſt that brings in their full ſheaves; this is the great ſupporter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy; this maintains their pomp, and ſtate, and wealth: the Fire of Purgatory would be quite extinguiſhed; the price of Indulgences would fall; and ſoul-Maſſes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109869:119"/> would be at a very low rate; beſides, many other new-coyn'd commodious Articles of Faith would vaniſh out of the world, if the common people ſhould be permitted to read the Scriptures to be inſtructed in points of Faith.</p>
               <p>The meaning of that reſtriction, which he lays upon the allowance, that (as he ſays) is made by the Roman Church, is as dark and doubtful as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Aſtrologers; but I ſhall uſe my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find it out: The Text which he hath quoted ſpeaks not one word of reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nor of any limited meaſure of knowledge, which is to be attained by reading of them: If he uſe theſe words (<hi>unto ſobriety</hi>) in the ſame ſence with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. c. 12. v.</hi> 3. they are to be taken in oppoſition to exceſs, and then he muſt ſay that the extent of this allowance, which is granted unto the common people for reading of the Scripture reaches no further, but to the attainment of that Wiſdom, which is bounded with Moderation, that they may not be exceſſively wiſe.</p>
               <p>But then I muſt ask firſt what this wiſdom to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is, for the preventing of which, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is thus circumſpect: I never heard, nor did I ever read of any perſon that was made too wiſe by reading of the Scriptures, nor will any real Chriſtia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, What are the bounds of Moderation, within the Compaſs of which it is the care of the Roman Church to keep the wiſdom of the common people? he will be as hard puzled to anſwer this, unleſs he will ſay, that it is the greateſt ſecurity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to ſay, the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ſhe can make for her ſelf, that the common people ſhall not diſcern thoſe follies and errours that are impoſed upon them to be believed and practiſed; and then we know what this allowance to be wiſe to ſobriety is. The ſureſt way to keep a man from Gluttony, is to keep him quite without Meat: And the ſureſt way to keep a man from Drunkenneſs, is to keep him quite without Drink. Thus the ſureſt way to keep the common people from diſcerning thoſe follies and errours that are impoſed upon them, is to keep them quite without Scripture; this is the allowance that is granted by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be wiſe to ſobriety, as is very evident by that ſtrict prohibition that was made by <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th, <hi>Biblia vulgari lingua edita legi non poſſunt, nec retineri;</hi> Bibles in the vulgar Tongue muſt not be read nor kept: and it is undeniable, that one among a thouſand of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the Bible in poſſeſſion.</p>

Is the writing of a Prieſt, or a Pope, or a Council, more virtual and powerful than the writing of the Holy Spirit, that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that will open the eyes of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make them really cautious, and wiſe, and Orthodox, while the reading of the Scriptures will produce the contrary effects? unto what height of wickedneſs is this Gentleman tranſported, to act contrary to the common notions of Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p>How much Atheiſtical he declares himſelf to be, by reproaching the Word of the ever-living God, I ſhall not determine; but I will be bold to ſay, that the Chriſtianity practiſed by him is not conformable to the pattern of <hi>Trent;</hi> he will not reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Traditions after this manner, and ſay, that the knowledge of them is to be with-held from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people for the preventing of Hereſie, and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Ignorance, and Preſumption, and Science falſely ſo called; and that the holy Scriptures ſhould receive as great reſpect from him, was decreed by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> denouncing an Anathema againſt ſuch as do not receive them both <hi>pari pietatis affectu,</hi> with an affection equally pious.</p>
               <p>The reading of the holy Scriptures doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any of theſe things, but the contrary effects; Timothy (2 <hi>Epiſt. ad Tim.</hi> c. 3. v. 15, 16, 17.) <hi>Knew the Scriptures from a Child,</hi> yet was neither he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, nor blind, nor ignorant, nor falſely wiſe; nay, the Apoſtle told him, that <hi>they were able to make him wiſe unto ſalvation;</hi> and that <hi>they are profitable

               <p>But how can the reading of the holy Scriptures be both allowed and reſtrained? this is like unto his teaching of the common people how to faſt and to eat both at the ſame time; though they eat Fiſh, he will tell them that they faſt from Fleſh; but this is but a mock-faſt: and ſo though the reading of the holy Scriptures be reſtrained for the preventing of Hereſie, and Blindneſs, and Ignorance, and Preſumption, and Science falſely ſo called, yet it is allowed to be wiſe to ſobriety; but this is but a mock-allowance, theſe things being inconſiſtent. If the reading of the holy Scriptures be reſtrained for the preventing of thoſe deſtructive inconveniences, it cannot be allowed to

               <p>I ſuppoſe he will now ſay that I have ſet his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the Rack, and tortured them to make them ſpeak quite contrary to his meaning; but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal unto any indifferent Judge to weigh his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and if he do not ſay that I have charged no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon him but what is plainly expreſſed, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deduced from his words, I will acknowledge my ſelf to be ſo impotent in my own defence, that I do not underſtand common Engliſh.

               <p>WOuld he forbear the uſe of this Term <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> until he had proved the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be the Catholick Church, and the Tenents wherein ſhe differs from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, to be Catholick Doctrine; his Pen would never ſpeak this Language. The Reader is to take notice, that whereſoever he uſeth this Title, as pertinent to his Church or Religion, it is to be taken abuſively: and verily I muſt ſay, That in teaching his Premiſes to bring forth Concluſions, his Faculty is admirable. Firſt, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of a Sacrifice: Secondly, of an Imitative Sacrifice: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He holds the Real Preſence, That the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really, properly, and externally ſacrificed in the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. Lo, theſe are his Demonſtrations.</p>
               <p>Now ſome inquiſitive Logician, that ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Logick, will be ready to ask him, how he knew the Mind of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> that he durſt conclude thus <hi>à genere ad ſpeciem,</hi> and <hi>à ſigno ad ſignatum;</hi> that becauſe Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of a Sacrifice, and of an Imitative Sacrifice, therefore he meant a particular, proper, and external Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? As if he ſhould ſay, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of an Animal, therefore he ſpeaks of an Horſe; as if there were no other Animals in the World but Horſes: and as if he ſhould ſay, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of the Embaſſador, therefore he ſpeaks of the King; as if there were no Perſonal difference between the Embaſſador and the King.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:109869:122"/>
               <p>But Proteſtants do deny all proper, real and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Sacrifice; thus he proves the Conſequence: But thus (as Tinkers uſe to do) in ſtead of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Hole, he makes two. Verily he was to blame with himſelf, to toil in ſearching into Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Writings, to know whether his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Controverted Particulars be the ſame that is maintained by the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to prove it to be contradictory to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Proteſtants. Here, at a pinch, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity hath found out an Inference that will ſpeedily do the whole Work, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble: <hi>What Proteſtants do deny, Pope</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>doth affirm; therefore he maintained the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the preſent</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Doctrine of the Proteſtants.</hi> But beſides the diſability that is in the Antecedent, for the proof of the Conſequence; it is no more true than <hi>Chawcer</hi>'s Winter-Tales, that are meer Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Proteſtants do acknowledge That One true, proper, and real Sacrifice of the Son of God, once offered upon the Croſs, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Sinners, which is remembred and repreſented in the Sacrament of the Lords Sup-Supper; and beſides, they do acknowledge the infinite Value and Efficacy of that Sacrifice, which the Romaniſts do deny, by maintaining the Neceſſity of a frequent Repetition of it.</p>
               <p>As there was a proper and external Sacrifice, ſo there is a ſpiritual Sacrifice, and a figurative and myſtical Sacrifice; and it is plain to him that will open his Eyes to ſee, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of a figurative and myſtical Sacrifice: he tells us, That it is a Sacrifice by imitation; and that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109869:122"/> which is a Sacrifice by imitation, cannot be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifice; as he that imitates the King of <hi>France,</hi> cannot therefore be ſaid to be really the King of <hi>France.</hi> It was a Practice uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in <hi>England,</hi> by Boys in their Sports, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Prieſts in ſinging of Maſſes; I ſuppoſe he will not therefore conclude, that they were true and proper Prieſts. Beſides, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> terms the Sacrifice which he ſpeaks of, a Myſtical Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſays, That it renews the Death of the Son of God <hi>per myſterium,</hi> by a Myſtery; and in the ſame ſenſe that his Blood is poured into the Mouths of the Faithful, and his Fleſh divided to the Health of his People, muſt this Sacrifice be taken. Now Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> could not hold, nor can this Gentleman ſay, That his Blood is properly and really poured into the Mouths of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that his Fleſh is really and properly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the Health of his People, but onely in a myſtical ſenſe.</p>
               <p>He tells me a Tale, That the Sacrifice of the Lords Supper is a Repreſentative, unbloody, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sacrifice, applying the general and bloody Sacrifice; which agrees with ſome of his former Expreſſions as Light and Darkneſs do together, and hangs in its ſelf as coherently as a Rope of Sand. This Sacrifice which he ſpeaks of, muſt be really the ſame that was offered upon the Croſs, or really another. He cannot ſay that it was really another, becauſe he cannot ſay that it is another <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is ſacrificed, and another Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is offered; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not ſeveral diſtinct Bodies: Wherefore he muſt ſay, that it is the ſame Sacrifice: And it exceeds
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109869:123"/> my Underſtanding to apprehend, how the ſame Sacrifice can be bloody and unbloody, particular and general, a repreſentation and the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, the thing applying and applied, the imitation and the thing imitated. When he writes again, he will proclaim his Wiſdom wonderfully to the World, if he ſhall unfold theſe Riddles, and reconcile theſe Contradictions: And the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he ſpeaks of being inviſible, (for, What Prieſt is there among the Romaniſts that can ſee the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament?) it will be a further promulgation of his Wiſdom, to tell how that Sacrifice which is inviſible, can be a Repreſentation of that which was viſible.</p>
               <p>It is a double Injury to the Memory of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> to interpret his Words in that ſenſe, which chargeth him with theſe groſs Abſurdities and Contradictions, and makes him to maintain an Opinion that is firſt contradictory to the clear evidence of Scripture; the Scripture tells us plainly, That it was not a Sacrifice to be offered up unto God, but a Sacrament given unto the Diſciples, which our Saviour did inſtitute: <hi>Take,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>eat and drink, and do this in remembrance of me.</hi> In all the Paſſages and Circumſtances of the Inſtitution, there is not the leaſt mention made of any Oblation; and the very Words of Inſtitution are as contrary to the Corporeal real Preſence, as Light is unto Darkneſs: <hi>This is my Body</hi> (ſays our Saviour): The Demonſtrative <hi>This</hi> muſt be referred unto ſomething that was preſent, and had a Being; for a <hi>Non ens</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonſtrated: and ſomething that was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109869:123"/> viſible, otherwiſe the Diſciples could not have underſtood our Saviours meaning; and that which is inviſible cannot be demoſtrated to the Eyes: But this thing could not be the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contained under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bread, for That (according to the Opinion of the Romaniſts) is not in the Sacrament until the laſt Syllable of the Words of Inſtitution be pronounced; and it is viſible to the Eye that it is not to be ſeen there: It was Bread that was preſent, and Bread that was viſible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Demonſtrative <hi>This</hi> muſt be referred unto That. This is cleared, beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, by the foregoing Words, <hi>As they were eating, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> Matth. cap. 26. v. 26. What can be plainer? It was real Bread which our Saviour took, and that he bleſſed, and that he brake, and that he gave unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and of that he ſaid, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Part of the Inſtitution is as clear, <hi>This</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins.</hi> What doth the Demonſtrative <hi>This</hi> relate unto here? It muſt be that which was contained in the Cup, the continent being put for the thing contained, of which mention was made before; <hi>And he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it,</hi> Matth. cap. 26. ver. 27. which, by the confeſſion of the Romaniſts, muſt be Wine;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109869:124"/> for, as I ſaid before, according to their own Tenets, until the laſt Syllable of the Words of Inſtitution be uttered, the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not in the Sacrament; and it is evident, that our Saviour bad his Diſciples drink of it, before he uttered thoſe Words: Beſides, after the Words of Inſtitution, in the following Verſe, he tells them expreſly, that it was the Fruit of the Vine; <hi>I will not drink henceforth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I drink it new in my Fathers Kingdom,</hi> Matth. cap. 26. ver. 29.</p>
               <p>Dare any of the Romaniſts affirm, That our Saviour falſified his own Words? He ſaid that he would <hi>go away, John cap. 16. ver.</hi> 5. and <hi>leave the World, ver.</hi> 28. and <hi>be no more in the World, cap. 17. ver.</hi> 11. which connot be underſtood of his Deity, for that is Omnipreſent; nor of his ſpiritual Preſence, for that was promiſed to his Diſciples, and is with his People, and in his Ordinances: Wherefore it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his Humanity. Nor muſt it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of an imaginary, but of a real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Will the Romaniſts affirm, That though he ſaid theſe things, yet he would not go away, nor leave the World, but be in it Corporally, under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bread and Wine? And will they contradict the Voice and Teſtimony of Angels? <hi>Ye men of Galilee,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? This ſame Jeſus, which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as you have ſeen him go into Heaven,</hi> Act. Apoſt. c. 1. v. 11.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109869:124"/> which muſt be underſtood likewiſe of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And how could he be taken from them, if he was ſtill with them Corporally in the Sacrament? And how could he be ſaid to come again, if he was not taken from them? And how can it be ſaid that he comes again inviſibly, and ingloriouſly, under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Bread and Wine; while the Angels ſaid, That when he came again, it ſhould be after the ſame manner in which he went away, that is, viſibly and gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words of Inſtitution; and had he known that the Romiſh Senſe was to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them, being that he was ſo earneſtly deſirous (as he expreſſed, 1 <hi>Epiſt. ad Cor. cap. 2. ver.</hi> 2.) to inſtruct the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe Myſteries that related unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he would not haue concealed it from them; but while he treated of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, would have told them plainly, that in the uſe of it they were not to believe their own Senſes, though they did feel, and ſee, and taſte Bread and Wine, yet they were to know that it was not Bread and Wine, but the real and proper Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But he declares no ſuch thing, telling them with ſeveral Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it was Bread, and it was the Cup, that is, Wine in the Cup after Conſecration; and applying ſeveral Actions to thoſe Elements, which could not be uſed to the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>breaking,</hi> and <hi>eating,</hi> and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109869:125"/> 
                  <hi>drinking, 1 Epiſt. ad Cor. cap. 11. ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28. Beſides, he tells them, That <hi>the Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt; and the Bread which we break, is the Communion of the Body of Chriſt, 1 Epiſt. ad Cor cap. 10. ver.</hi> 16. Theſe Words muſt be taken as an Expoſition of the Words of Inſtitution; otherwiſe ſpeaking of the ſame thing which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſpeak of, how could he expreſs it better, than by conforming his Words to the Pattern of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſaying, That the Cup which we bleſs is the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Bread which we break is the Body of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> But in ſtead of this, he ſays, That the Cup and the Bread is a Communion of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whence it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That the Subſtance of Bread and Wine remains after Conſecration, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not Corporally in the Sacrament: For, a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be the ſame thing with that of which it is a Communion; nor doth this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, require the Corporal Preſence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> any more than that Communion which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> received while they were journeying towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by which they did partake of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do by theirs: The Apoſtle ſays, That <hi>they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink; for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock which followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt, 1 Epiſt. ad Cor. cap. 10. ver. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. And we are aſſured, that to be ſaved, there was not one way for them, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109869:125"/> for Chriſtians; but as Chriſtians are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> that did come, and hath ſuffered in the World; ſo they were ſaved by <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was to come, and to ſuffer in the World. And this is as true, That their Communion could not require the Corporal Preſence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it being celebrated many Centuries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into the World.</p>
               <p>That Text which is frequently quoted by the Romaniſts in favour of their Opinion, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no Life in you,</hi> John <hi>cap. 6. ver.</hi> 53. makes a great ſound in the ears of the Common People; but while it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to that purpoſe, how ſhamefully it is perverted, contrary to our Saviour's meaning, is evident to every one that will open his Eyes to ſee. Firſt, It cannot have any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a Corporal eating and drinking of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be made in the Sacrament, becauſe the Words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at leaſt a year before the Sacrament was Inſtituted, which is acknowledged by ſeveral of the Romiſh Doctors. Beſides, the Eating and Drinking which our Saviour ſpeaks of, is ſure to produce the Fruit of Eternal Life: <hi>Whoſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life,</hi> ver. 54. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be verified of a Sacramental Eating and Drinking. <hi>Judas</hi> (according to the Opinion of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) had the Sacrament of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood adminiſtred unto him; and the Romaniſts themſelves muſt acknowledge,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109869:126"/> that wicked Perſons do receive that which (they ſay) is the real and proper Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> unleſs they will affirm (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed with any colour of Truth) That no ſuch Perſons are to be found in their Society.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a Spiritual Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is ſpoken of in that Text, as appears plainly by ſeveral Contexts. The Diſciples being offended with our Saviour's Expreſſion, to heal that Sore, and take away the Offence, he tells them how it was to be underſtood, <hi>What and if</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing: The Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> ver. 62. &amp; 63. Which is as if he had ſaid, You muſt not think that I ſpeak of a Corporal eating and drinking of my real Body and Blood; for this cannot be done: I muſt leave the World, you ſhall ſee me aſcend with my Body into Heaven: It is a Spiritual eating and drinking which I do ſpeak of, for it is that onely which is profitable, a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eating and drinking doth not profit. This is further cleared by that which is expreſſed before, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood,</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> ver. 56. What kind of In-dwelling is this which he ſpeaks of? It cannot be Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; for it cannot be ſaid that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelleth Bodily in a Chriſtian, or a Chriſtian Bodily in him: Wherefore it muſt be Spiritual;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109869:126"/> and then this eating of the Fleſh, and drinking of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt be alſo Spiritual. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> affirms them both to be one thing, making the latter to be an Expoſition of the former: <hi>Hoc eſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>manducare illam eſcam, &amp; illum potum bibere, in Chriſto manere, &amp; illum manentem in ſe habere; This is the eating of that Meat, and the drinking of that Drink, for a Man to dwell in Chriſt, and to have Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him: Agust. in Johan. Tract.</hi> 26. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is this undeniable Reaſon expreſſed in the Text; the Eating and Drinking which is ſpoken of, is abſolutely neceſſary for the obtaining of Eternal Life; <hi>Except</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>you eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no Life in you:</hi> Which cannot be ſaid of a Corporal eating and drinking, without the uncharitable guilt of excluding all Infants and Children, who dying in their Minority, and all others who through any invincible neceſſity do not receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, from a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of obtaining Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Spiritual eating and drinking of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> This is likewiſe evident by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Contexts. Our Saviour injoyns the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom he preached, to <hi>labour, nor for the Meat that periſheth, but for the Meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures unto Life everlaſting,</hi> ver. 27. Upon which, in the following Verſe, they propound this Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall we do that we might work the Works of God?</hi> Which is as if they had
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109869:127"/> ſaid, (and this muſt be the meaning of the Words, taking them in a right Coherence with the former) What muſt we do to gain the Meat that endures unto Life Everlaſting, for that is to work the Works of God: To which our Saviour returns this Anſwer, <hi>This is the Work of God, that you believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> ver. 29. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Fleſh and Blood is the Meat and Drink that endures unto Life everlaſting; and it is plain, that to believe in him, is to work for it, to gain it, to eat and drink it. This is further evidenced by what follows; <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the Bread of Life; he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall never thirſt,</hi> ver. 35. What can be more plain than this? He tells us that this Bread is his Fleſh, that he would give for the Life of the World; and it is evident, that to come to him, is to believe in him; and to believe in him, is to eat that Bread: therefore it is, that he that believeth in him, ſhall never hunger; and ſo to believe in him, is to drink his Blood; therefore it is that he that believeth in him, ſhall never thirſt. Certainly the Romaniſts will grant, that it is Eating and Drinking that doth ſatiate the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, to the preventing of hungring and thirſting.</p>
               <p>While our Saviour doth attribute the gaining of Eternal Life to Eating and Drinking, and the very ſame effect to Believing, as is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtified in the Holy Scripture, <hi>John c. 6. ver. 47. &amp; cap. 3. ver. 15, 16. &amp; cap. 5. ver.</hi> 24. and while there are ſuch great and ſaving Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects aſcribed unto Faith, as that by it we are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109869:127"/> regenerated, by it we are juſtified, by it we are the Children of God, by it we overcome our Spiritual Enemies; and all this, becauſe Faith is the Hand that lays hold on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who works all our Works in us and for us, and from whoſe fulneſs we receive all that is neceſſary unto Eternal Salvation; who can be ſo ſenſeleſs as to think, that this Eating and Drinking of Fleſh and Blood, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks of, can be any other thing, but an unfeigned believing in him? I ask the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, Whether the Fathers that lived and died before the Nativity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, in that ſenſe of which he ſpeaks? If they did not, how could they be ſaved, it being abſolutely neceſſary for obtaining Eternal Life? If they did, how could they do it otherwiſe than by Faith? And that they did it by Faith, is confirmed by our Saviours Expreſſion, telling the <hi>Jews,</hi> That <hi>their Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee his day, and he ſaw it, and was glad,</hi> John <hi>cap. 8. ver.</hi> 56. That day muſt be the day of his Nativity, and living and ſuffering in the Fleſh: And how did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſee this day? Surely it was by Faith, after which manner he did eat the Fleſh and drink the Blood of the Son of Man; for it is without doubt that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſaved by him.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, which (I hope) the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and impartial Reader will judge to be abundantly ſufficient to prove the repugnancy of the Romiſh Interpretation to our Saviours meaning, I ſhall add, for the conſideration of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109869:128"/> the Romaniſts, how ſutably their Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on works for them, diſplaying their Religion in fit and proper Colours to the view of the World. The Doctrine of the Romiſh Church is this, <hi>That it is not requiſite and neceſſary for the Laiety to partake of the Cup;</hi> according to which the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Leaders is conformed, they denying to adminiſter the Cup unto the Laiety: And our Saviours Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion being poſitive, declaring both the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Body, and the drinking of his Blood, to be equally and abſolutely neceſſary for obtaining Eternal Life; if by it we muſt underſtand a Corporal Eating and Drinking of his real and proper Body and Blood, then that Doctrine is damnably ſacrilegious, and that practice diabolically cruel. How dare the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts detain from the Common People that which is abſolutely neceſſary for them? and why will they ſend poor Souls in numberleſs numbers poſting to Damnation, by with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from them? The Concomitancy of the Blood with the Body cannot acquit them from this Guilt; for daily Experience doth inform us, that Eating is not Drinking: therefore the eating of the Body, cannot be the drinking of the Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This Opinion, which the Reflector endeavours to faſten upon Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Judgment of the Ancient Fathers. Some (I confeſs) have given out high Expeſſions concerning the Sacrament; but it was onely for this end, to beget in the minds
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109869:128"/> of Chriſtians a reverent Apprehenſion and Eſteem of it, and this to work upon them to entertain a greater Devotion in receiving it; but that they did not maintain this abſurd Opinion, is evident out of their Writings. <hi>Tertullian</hi> expounds thoſe Words of <hi>Chriſt, Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body,</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Hoc eſt figura corporis mei, This is a Figure of my Body,</hi> Tert. cont. Marc. lib. 4. cap. 40. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaking of the Sacrament of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body, uſeth theſe Terms, <hi>A Figure, a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, a Sign, a Token of Chriſt's Body,</hi> Amb. de Sacr. lib. 4. cap. 4, &amp; 5. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus adhibuit ad convivium Judas in quo corporis ſui figuram Diſcipulis ſuis commendavit,</hi> Chriſt <hi>took</hi> Judas <hi>unto his Table, whereat he gave his Diſciples a Figure of his Body,</hi> Auguſt. in Pſal. 3. &amp; cont. Adia. cap. 12. So St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Si mortuus non eſt, cujus ſymbolum ac ſignum eſt hoc Sacramentum? If Chriſt died not, whoſe Sign and whoſe Token is this Sacrament?</hi> Chryſoſt. in Matth. Hom. 83. And thus St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>In typo ſanguinis ſui non obtulit aquam ſed vinum, In token of his Blood, he offered not Water, but Wine,</hi> Jerom. adv. Jov. lib. 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is an Opinion that is contrary to Reaſon, firſt, That Chriſt ſhould be really and properly ſacrificed again in the Sacrament, to repreſent the Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Croſs: For, firſt, that Sacrifice once offered (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) was either perfect, or imperfect. To ſay that it was imperfect, is Blaſphemy; and to ſay that it was perfect, is to affirm that it cannot be iterated; <hi>contrariorum eſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109869:129"/> contraria ratio &amp; conſequentia;</hi> If the Imperfection of the Legal Sacrifices was a reaſon why they were to be repeated, as the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> doth abundantly teſtifie, <hi>Epiſt. ad Heb. cap. 7. &amp; cap.</hi> 10. certainly the Perfection of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, muſt be a reaſon why it cannot be repeated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs was not only perfect in its ſelf, but it alſo <hi>makes the comers thereunto perfect:</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>By one Sacrifice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. And can any thing be added to Perfection? Is there any need that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be again ſacrificed, while that one Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Croſs does all that is neceſſary to be done? Surely <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not have the Prieſt to do that which in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is altogether needleſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be really and properly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed again in the Sacrament, to repreſent the Sacrifice upon the Croſs, he muſt be ſacrificed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was in this World ſubject to Miſery and Mortality, or as he is now in Heaven living and glorious: But the firſt cannot be, becauſe Bodies that are glorified in Heaven cannot be ſubject to Miſery and Mortality any more; nor can the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond be, becauſe a living and a glorious Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repreſent, with any fit reſemblance or likeneſs, that Body which ſuffered, ſhed its Blood, and died; and to repreſent being to expoſe to the view ſome ſignification or ſign of the thing repreſented, the living and glorious Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be there to repreſent, where there is no ſuch repreſenting Body to be ſeen.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:109869:129"/>
               <p>Fourthly, That a Sacrifice may be real and proper, the thing ſacrificed muſt be deſtroyed, and beſides it muſt be viſible; this is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by their great Champion <hi>Bellarmin, (Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, de Miſſ.</hi> l. 1. c. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.) but we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Chriſt cannot be deſtroyed, he can dye no more, and that which the Romaniſts do ſay, is offered, is not to be perceived by any of the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is contrary to Reaſon, that Chriſts Body and Blood ſhould be really and properly in the Sacrament; firſt becauſe this is contrary to the end of the Sacrament, which was to be a Remembrance of Chriſt, and to ſhew the Lords Death until he come, do this (ſays our Saviour) in remembrance of me, and as often (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) as you eat this Bread and drink this Cup, you do ſhew the Lords Death till he come. The uſe of Memorials is only needful in Relation to Perſons that are abſent, need I any thing to put me in mind of my Friend, while I ſee him with mine Eyes, or know him to be cloſe by my ſide? and need I any thing to ſhew the Lords Death till he come, if he be not gone, but is preſent under the ſpecies of Bread and Wine to ſhew his own Death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is contrary to the conſtitutive parts of a Sacrament, which are a <hi>Signum</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ignatum,</hi> a ſign and the thing ſignified; If the Body of Chriſt and his Blood be really and properly in the Sacrament, I ask what is the viſible ſign? It cannot be the accidents belonging to Bread and Wine, theſe (according to the Opinion of the Romaniſts) muſt be left to hang in the air without a Subject, and indeed our Saviour did not ſay, this whiteneſs, or roundneſs, or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109869:130"/> or any other accident is my Body and Blood, nor could the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which (they ſay) is ſhadowed under the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, be ſaid to be the viſible ſign, becauſe it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> inviſible; but ſhould the Romaniſts (contrary to ſenſe) ſay this, it would confound the ſign and the thing ſignified, making them one and the ſame thing, for Chriſt hath not two ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Bodies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It chargeth Chriſt) who knew better how to ſpeak than the Pope himſelf, though he be pretended to be infallible, and the viſible Head of the Church) with a groſs Soleciſm, and Tautology; for if Chriſts Body and Blood was really and properly in the Sacrament, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words of Inſtitution muſt be this; <hi>This my Body is my Body, and this my Blood is my Blood.</hi>
               </p>

Againſt which Mr. <hi>Brerely</hi> (as wiſe and as ſtout a Champion as this Gentleman is) durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver object; and if from thence the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109869:134"/> of the Church may be concluded, why not likewiſe the Ordination of the Pope? Surely it will be granted, that the pretended Head was ſome part of the Church, and that his power did concur in that Ordination; and it is ſtrange that the Order which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> reports to be obſerved in celebrating the Maſs, ſhould not be by his own Ordination, being that he was (though not ſupream Head, yet) a Ruler in the Church; and eſpecially if that be true, which (the Reflector ſays) is teſtified by <hi>Beacon,</hi> to wit that the Maſs was fully compleated by him; certainly if this was done by him, he did give Order when, and where, and after what manner the Maſs was to be celebrated: Beſides, the words that were pronounced by the Deacon were Imperative, commanding the Noncommunicants to depart. Now the Reflector muſt ſay, that the cuſtom of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing that command was raiſed and continued either by the Ordination of the Deacon, or of the Pope, or the Church; he cannot ſay the firſt, becauſe the Office of the Deacon was but ſubſervient in the Church, and by ſaying either of the other, he will affirm that which he hath denyed, that there is ſomewhat of Ordination in the words, and that <hi>Gregory</hi> being Pope, it

               <p>But all this wind ſhakes no Corn; though this Objection do work its utmoſt againſt me, yet it is as trivial as that of the Cook, who excepted againſt a fat Capon, becauſe it wanted ſome feathers; notwithſtanding all this bluſtring ſtir that he makes, the truth which was affirmed ſtands unſhaken, that <hi>Gregory</hi> in his opinion differed from the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the private Maſs, which this Gentleman muſt acknowledge, or elſe he muſt ſay that the practice of the Roman Church in his time was contrary to his Opinion; for his words are plain and eaſie to be underſtood, <hi>cumque in eadem eccleſia,</hi> &amp;c. When Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were celebrated in the Church, and the Deacon according to cuſtom cryed out, if any doth not communicate, let him depart: his ſtrange diſtinction of ſolemn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolemn, or ſolemn and private cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the force of this teſtimony; it is folly in the abſtract to uſe a diſtinction, when it is known before hand that the controverſy is concerning that diſtinction, and it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that there was no ſuch diſtinction between Maſſes uſed in Pope <hi>Gregorys</hi> time, as is manifeſt from his words; for Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> doth not limit the exerciſe of that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:109869:135"/> cuſtom, which he ſpeaks of, to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day, but ſpeaks in the general, and ſays, when ſoever Maſſes were celebrated, and the Deacon according to cuſtom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>If any one doth not communicate let him depart;</hi> whence it may be aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, that whenſoever the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adminiſtred, it was the cuſtom of the Deacon to make this diſmiſſion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Non-communicants depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Church; while the reſt ſtayed to communicate with the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Should I comply to his humour, and ſuppoſe (contrary to the expreſs Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>) that the words were ſpoken of ſolemn in oppoſition to private Maſſes, we find in them, as they relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which follows, a convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the condemnation of private Maſſes, and to prove that the uſe of them is an abuſe and Prophanation of the ſacred Inſtitution of Chriſt. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an Apparition that was frequently made in the Church, The Spirits (ſays he) of two perſons that died while they lay under a threatned Sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, were obſerved to depart out of the Church whenſoever the Deacon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the Non-communicants. Whence
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:109869:136"/> we muſt conclude that when pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Maſſes were celebrated, thoſe Spirits reſided in the Church, becauſe then the diſmiſſion was not made: Now I ask this Gentleman, why they departed when the diſmiſſion was made, and what was the reaſon of their reſidence in the Church when it was not made? certainly he can return no other anſwer but this, when the People were admitted to communicate with the Prieſt, there was a ſecret divine Power working to drive ſuch Spirits away, commanding them to this purpoſe, <hi>procul hinc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul eſte prophani,</hi> therefore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was then celebrated according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt; but when private Maſſes were celebrated, there was no ſuch power working to that purpoſe; therefore the obſervance and uſe of them is not agreeable to that ſacred Inſtitution, but an abuſe and prophanation of it; and it is my perſuaſion that private Maſſes have many ſuch Attendants to take notice of the mimical geſtures of the Prieſt, and how much Chriſts ſacred Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abuſed and prophaned by his ſolitary receiving.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:109869:136"/>
               <p>But I need not be beholding unto Suppoſitions for Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the uſe of private Maſſes, or to prove the diſuſe of them in Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s time, for his Teſtimony is as clear as the Sun to evidence, that then it was the cuſtom of the Church to diſmiſs the Non-communicants when the Sacrament was to be adminiſtred; therefore there was none but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to ſtay in the Church, and there were ſome that did ſtay to communicate with the Prieſt; the Prieſt only did not receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the People being permitted to ſtand by as Spectators to take notice of his Actions, as is done now at the celebration of private Maſſes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt ſay that the Reaſon of the Reflector in the uſe of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Similitude runs as low as his confidence ſpeaks high: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great ſtrait, he is leſs to be blamed, becauſe it was the beſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he could invent to involve the Reader in a dark Miſt, that he might not diſcern the weakneſs of that Reply, that he makes to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Teſtimony.</p>

               <p>What parity is there between <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> and that time which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſays, <hi>cumque miſſarum ſolemnia celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur?</hi> and what parity is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſaying of Service at other times beſides <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and private Maſſes, which are not mentioned at all by Pope <hi>Gregory?</hi> And then what Reaſon is there why I may no more conclude againſt private Maſs from his words, then it can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſervice is not ſaid by me at any other time, becauſe I do adminiſter the Sacrament on <hi>Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?</hi> Similitudes do not always run on four Feet, but I never knew till now, that ſometime they have no Feet at all to ſtand on. Doth this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman conceit himſelf to be ſuch an infallible Doctor, that whatſoever is affirmed by him without proof, muſt be received as a certain truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Reaſon? And did <hi>Chytrers</hi> ſay, that the great private Maſſes were uſed in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, without any proof for what he ſaid? And did Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> maintain private Maſſes, yet no
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:109869:137"/> Expreſſions to be found in his Writings, ſounding to this purpoſe, <hi>If there be any, why is there not ſome Direction laid down where to find them?</hi> His Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (I ſee in his bold Aſſertions,) is but like unto a <hi>Caſtle built in the Air,</hi> without a Foundation; and the Standing of it will be wonderful, though it be not a Wonder, that it was the Product of one that profeſſeth himſelf to be a Pillar of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church.</p>
               <p>But I perceive, that his Second Thoughts do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Firſt, and now he falls from his former Confidence, <hi>At leaſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by the words of the Objection,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning of which muſt be this, I have been too bold in concluding againſt <hi>Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s words; for I muſt confeſs, that his Teſtimony is plain and poſitive againſt private Maſſes; but yet however, there is mention made of Maſſes, which are contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and argues <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>If this <hi>Gentleman</hi> had been as powerful in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> as he is confident in <hi>concluding,</hi> he would be among the <hi>Roman</hi> Champions, as the Chief was among <hi>David's Worthies;</hi> but it is his ſad misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that his <hi>Conſequences</hi> are meer ſtrangers to his <hi>Antecedents,</hi> and his <hi>Premiſes</hi> altogether unable to bring forth his <hi>Concluſions:</hi> He may take notice, that the term <hi>Miſſa,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Maſs,</hi> was not uſed by the Fathers and Doctors of the Primitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church; and when it came moſt into uſe, it was of different Significations; ſometimes it ſignified the <hi>Aſſembling of Gods People,</hi> ſometimes it ſignified <hi>Common Prayers,</hi> ſometimes it ſignified the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:109869:138"/> Now, I ſuppoſe, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will not ſay, That Aſſemblies, or Communions, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers, are contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> In this Expreſſion, which is quoted, <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>When Maſſes were to be Celebrated,</hi> ſpeaking in relation to that which was to be done, after the Deacon had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the Non-Communicants; but he ſays, <hi>When Maſſes were Celebrated,</hi> ſpeaking in relation to that which was done before the Deacon made this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; wherefore it is evident, that <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> by Maſſes, doth underſtand that Common Service, which was performed before the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament; and then, where is the Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction incurred by me, or charged by me upon <hi>Pope Gregory?</hi> It ſeems, this <hi>Gentleman</hi> entertains an Opinion, that travails far beyond the Limits of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> being that he would have the Corporal Preſence to be where and whenſoever any kind of Maſſes were Celebrated.</p>
               <p>If the Uſe of the term <hi>Maſs</hi> be ſo powerful to conclude, what does he think of the Diſuſe of it? May not I more rationally and firmly conclude from the Negative, than he can do from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, the term <hi>Maſs</hi> was never uſed by our Saviour, or his Apoſtles? The learned Doctor <hi>Jewell,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> tells us, <hi>That it was not uſed by the Doctors and Fathers of the Primitive-Church for Three hundred years after Chriſt; and that it was ſeldom uſed by St.</hi> Auguſtin, <hi>St.</hi> Jerom, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, <hi>St.</hi> Cyprian, Arnobius, Lactantius; <hi>and that unto St.</hi> Chriſoſtom, Baſil, Nazianſen, Gregory Niſſen, <hi>and all other Greek Writers, it was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;</hi> therefore the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109869:138"/> England</hi> is the ſame that was maintained by them and the Doctrine of the <hi>Private Maſs,</hi> and <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> was never owned by them.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> take notice what a load of Injuries is laid by this <hi>Gentleman</hi> upon <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> charging him with an opinion, which is firſt contradictory to his own plain and poſitive Expreſſions, as I have already in ſome meaſure ſhewed, and have farther yet to ſhew; If <hi>Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> did allow of <hi>Private Maſs,</hi> how could that Prayer ſuit unto the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which he penned to be uſed after the Receiving of it; <hi>Ut quotquot ex hac altaris participatione ſacroſanctum filii tui corpus &amp; ſanguinem ſumpſerimus omni benedictione coeleſti &amp; gratia repleamur?</hi> That as many of us, as by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this Altar, have received the holy Body and Blood of thy Son, may be filled with all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Benediction and Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Contrary to the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for it was not a Private Maſs, but a Communion, that was inſtituted, and adminiſtred by Him, and He commanded the Diſciples to do the ſame in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Contrary to the Injunction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to <hi>tarry one for another in the Holy Adminiſtration, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their practice to the example of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Contrary to the Canons of the Apoſtles; for in them it is decreed, <hi>That if any reſort unto the Church, and hear the Scriptures, and abſtain from the Communion, that he ſhall ſtand excommunicate as one that troubleth the Congregation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Contrary to the Nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; His own Doctor <hi>Harden,</hi> in his Anſwer to the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> concerning the Private Maſs, tells us, <hi>That in Chriſts Inſtitution three things are contained, which Himſelf did, and by His gave Authority to the Church to do the ſame; the Conſecration, the Oblation, and the Participation.</hi> Now in Private Maſs, I deſire to know where this <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation</hi> is?</p>
               <p>

But more plainly in that Method and Order of Conſecration, which <hi>Gregory</hi> appointed to be obſerved in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> we find that the Cup was to be conſecrated for the Laity, as well as the Bread; and in that Prayer, which he penned to be uſed after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, there is mention made of the Cup as well as of the Bread, <hi>Greg de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra.</hi>

It is not the Repreſentative Church; for there was not a General Councel in the World for Three hundred
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109869:143"/> years after Chriſt: And will he ſay, that in all this time the Sacrament was Adminiſtred (as it was) in both kinds, to the Laity, without an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is not a Particular Church, That cannot make any Sanction, that ſhall be Obliging to the Whole Church. It is not the Virtual Church, which ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have the Pope to be, by this Gentleman's Aſſertion Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected, and a manifeſt difference expreſſed to be between him, and the Church that is ſpoken of; <hi>Let him Speak or Write what he will, it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs it be the Inſtitution of the Church.</hi> Nor can it be the Conſiſtorial Church (as ſome <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> do likewiſe ſpeak) the Sacrament was Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to the Laity in both kinds, before any Pope did ſit at <hi>Rome,</hi> and before ever the Pope and his Conclave of Cardinals were heard of. And had he meant this Church, he could not have except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Teſtimony, nor have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between him and the Church, being the Pope is the cheif part of this Church, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm; and certainly what he Writes is, <hi>ex Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> with the conſent and approbation of his glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and Princely Cardinals; wherefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all is this, That this Church which hath Power to Ordain and Appoint the Communicating of the Laity under one kind, or both kinds, as She pleaſeth, is not to be found: And then what Truth is to be found in his Expreſſions, let the World judge.</p>
               <p>But for a farther diſcovery, let us inquire what ſtrength is produced to determine the Queſtions; had not this Gentleman conceited that an empty
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109869:144"/> flouriſh of words would paſs for Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations with his Followers, he would never have expoſed this Stuff to the view of any Reader; <hi>The Catholick Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and hath always Taught, That there is no neceſſity or divine Precept for the Laity to Communicate under both kinds; but it is ſufficent and lawful for them to do it under one or both, as the Church appoints; ſo that the Precept herein being not Divine, but only Eccleſiaſtical, the Church hath Power to Ordain and Diſpenſe with it according to the various exigencies and occaſions of Times and Places; and accordingly ſometimes has allowed of Communion under both kinds, and at other times has forbidden it, as She judged it more expedient for the Receivers, or the Reverence of the Sacrament it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is nothing but a vain Repetition of the Churches Doctrine, and a Concluding like the Dancing about a Maypole, tracing of the ſame ſteps backward and forward, becauſe there is no Divine Precept (as the Church Teacheth) forthe Layety to Communicate under both kinds, therefore the Church hath Power to make it to be ſufficient and lawful to do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one or both: and becauſe the Church hath Power to do this, therefore the Precept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Communicating of the Laity is Eccleſiaſtical; and becauſe the Precept is Ecleſiaſtical, therefore the Church hath
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:109869:144"/> Power to Ordain the Communicating of the Laity under one or both kinds; which is as like to be true as this, becauſe the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er begets the Son, therefore the Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the Father; and becauſe the Mother brings forth the Daughter therefore the Daughter, brings forth the Mother; and all this Teaching and Concluding diveſted of its impertinent Words and Tautologies, and put into a proper and fit Dreſs, is but one pittiful Doctrine, That the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath always taught that Chriſt did not give any Command for the Communicating of the Laity in both kinds, but left it to the Ordering and Appointment of the Church, according as exegencies and occaſions fell out, and according as She judges moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the Receivers, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Reverence towards the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for which theſe Reaſons are given, becauſe there is as much in one kind as in both; and becauſe our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, and alſo his Apoſtles did Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacrament to the Laity under one kind. Now, to prove that this hath been always taught by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and that in Teaching this, the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath taught nothing but Truth; and to prove that there is as much in one kind as in both, and that Chriſt and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109869:145"/> his Apoſtles did Adminiſter the Sacrament to the Laity in one kind, there is not one Sillable produced; the Reader muſt take all this upon his own bare word: But if he believe it to be true, he is as careleſs in employing of his Faith, as a Prodigal is of his Purſe; for there is not one word of Truth to be found in it. And to make this plain to the view of every one, I ſhall propound theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Quaeries?</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is that <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which hath always Taught that there is no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precept for the Laity to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate under both kinds? If it be all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, they were not all Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; if the Leaders and Doctors of ſome particular Ages, they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the World to Teach; if the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Doctors of every Age, I hope he will admit our Saviour Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſeveral Antient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fathers into the number of the Leaders and Doctors of the firſt Ages: And where did our Saviour Chriſt or his Apoſtles, or which of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fathers did Teach this Doctrine, That there is no Divine Precept for the Laity to Communicate both kinds?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:109869:145"/>2. Who taught the Catholick Church to teach this Doctrine; is it of God, or of men? if it be of men, it is like unto the Author, deceitful and lighter than vanity; if it be of God, where, and to whom was it revealed? it is very neceſſary make this inquiſition, becauſe there are many Doctrines obtruded by the Roman Leaders upon the common people, under the name of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Church, which are nothing but the meer ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of erring and deceitful men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who did inveſt the Church with power to ordain and appoint the Layety to communicate under one kind? if our Saviour Chriſt, let his Commiſſion be produced; where did he ſpeak to any Church under Heaven? ſaying expreſly or implicitely, Take thou power to do as thou pleaſeſt in Adminiſtring the Sacrament to the Layety, if there be any Text of Scripture ſounding to this purpoſe, why doth he not quote it? if there be none, how can he prove that the Church hath this power? That Church which preſumes to do this without a Commiſſion from Chriſt, is an impudent uſurper for invading and aſſuming the Royal Prerogative, which is pertinent and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar only unto Chriſt; and an abſolute Tyrant in hindering the common people from the uſe of that liberty; which by the appointment and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, they are priviledged to enjoy.</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109869:146"/> otherwiſe this is as much as nothing at all; for it is viſible to him that is not wilfully blind, that the real and proper body and blood of Chriſt is not there, and it is utterly incredible that the glorious body of Chriſt ſhould be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and debaſed to the licentious diſpoſing of a mortal ſinful man; if as much of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? how can a Wafer cake, or a peace of bread repreſent and ſignify the effuſion of that precious blood, which was abundantly ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World? if as much of the efficacy? why did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. and how could he vent that expreſſion, attributing and appropriating different effects to the differing kinds, the cup of bleſſing (ſaith he) which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread which we break is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt? <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> one of his own Doctors delivers an opinion quite contrary unto him affirming that there is not as much in one kind as in both, <hi>Licet</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>illa ſumptio, quae eſt in accipiend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How can it be expedient for the Layety to Communicate in one kind, yet as the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church doth declare, alwayes nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary for the Prieſts to receive both kinds? as there is but one Ld one Faith, one Baptiſm, ſo there is but one Inſtitution of the Lords Supper, one Chriſt the Author of that Inſtitution, of whom the Layety do ſtand in as much need, and in whom they are as much intereſted as the Prieſts; is it not always as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Layety as it is for the Prieſts to receive the ſign and Seal of that pretious effuſion, which was made for the Redemption of the world in which they are as much intereſted as the Preiſts.</p>

               <p>It is not the Catholick Church that any time, but the <hi>Pope's</hi> creatures, that of late dayes have taught thoſe groſs untruths, that are viſible to every one that will open his eyes to ſee, and that they are ſuch I ſhall prove by theſe following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; firſt, Chriſt did inſtitute the Sacrament for the Layety, or he did not; if he did not, what have they to do with it? it is not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, or any ſociety of men that can give them a title to the uſe of it; he only that conferrs the inward grace, can inſtitute and appoint the outward and viſible ſign and Seal, and beſtow a title and priviledge to uſe it if he did inſtitute
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:109869:148"/> the Sacrament for the layety, it was in both kinds that he made this inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Layety are as much concerned and included in the end of the Sacrament, as the Prieſts are, that is the remembrance of Chriſt, therefore as much concerned and included in Chriſt's command, do this, eat this bread, and drink this cup in remembrance of me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not all Prieſts, and that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> received from Chriſt concerning the Sacrament, was Chriſt's own inſtitution; now it is as clear as the ſun, that the Apoſtle received the inſtitution in both kinds, and accordingly gave the <hi>Corinthians</hi> an Injunction to receive in both kinds, but let a man (ſayes he,) examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>

               <p>I have dwelt too long upon the confutation of a rude heap of vain and empty words; for a concluſion of this particular, I ſhall deſire the reader to take notice; firſt, that this Gentleman ſayes that the expreſſion imputed to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes nothing of a command, or of a neceſſity of receiving the Sacrament under both kinds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Sacrament would not be entire; and yet he ſayes afterwards that whenſoever Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> or any other of the Fathers ſpeak of the Layety receiving the Sacrament under both kinds, they ſpeak of ſuch times in which the Church ſo appointed and commanded the adminiſtration of it.</p>
               <p>What muſt be done to reconcile theſe diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions, either he muſt ſay that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Church is a meer nullity, and there is no neceſſity to obey it, or that the report of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and other antient Fathers diſanulls the command of the Church, and renders it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to be obeyed, or when the Church Commands the adminiſtration of the Sacrament in both kinds, ſhe commands more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be done, when he writes again, he will tell me which of theſe aſſertions he will chooſe to maintain, ſure he will not make choice of maintain, ſure he will not make choice of the laſt, and ſay that the Church can be guilty of ſo great an errour, as to command more than belongs unto the integrity of a Sacrament; and then it cannot be entire when it is adminiſtred in one kind; unleſs he will ſay that the Church hath Power to make the Sacrament entire in one
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:109869:149"/> kind, or entire in both kinds as ſhe pleaſeth; and it is the ſame Sacrament ſtill, whither it be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one kind, or both kinds, which is as much as to ſay that the Church hath Power to make two to be no more than one, and one to be as much as two; that ſhe can make that body which wants a leg or an arm, as perfect as that body, which hath both legs and armes; that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corporall prefence, ſhe hath power to dilate and extend the body of Chriſt as he pleaſeth; for when the Sacrament is adminiſtred in both kinds, his body according to that opinion, muſt be more dilated and extended; unleſs he will ſay that then his blood is ſeparated from his body, his body being contained under one kind, his blood under the other, which (I ſuppoſe) he will not do, becauſe his blood cannot be ſeparated from his body; and when it is adminiſtred in one kind, it muſt be more contracted, it is much to aſcribe this hideous power to an unknown Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he ſayes that the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament ſometime in one kind, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in both kinds proves and confirms the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; and a little before he told us, that the authority and Power of the Church makes it to be ſufficient and Lawful to adminiſter either in one kind or both kinds; it is very charitably and gratefully done by two crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to help one another over the ſtile; he ſhould firſt prove that the Church hath power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command this twofold and different adminiſtration, otherwiſe it is ſo far from prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power and authority of the Church, that her precept for admininiſtring, and the practice of the People in receiving in one kind, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate rebellion againſt Chriſt, by a wilful viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſacred inſtitution.</p>

                  </gap>hough it be out of a worm eaten and rotten bow; but to help his weakneſs, and to free my ſelf from that odious imputation, which, had it been juſt, would have been the ſtrongeſt argument in all his book, let him ſearch into the ninth Book of <hi>Gregoryes</hi> morals upon <hi>Job.</hi> 11. C. where he will find theſe words, <hi>Si ad opus virtutis excrevero, ad vitam, non ex meritis, ſed ex venia convaleſco,</hi> if I do increaſe in vertue, I grow unto life not our of merit, but by pardon; and in the expoſition of the firſt penitential Pſalm he will find this expreſſion, <hi>Non de meis meritis confidens ut me ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum facias ſupplico, ſed de ſola miſericordia tua praeſumens impetrare, quod non de meis meritis ſpero,</hi> I intreat to be ſaved, not confiding in my own merits, but preſuming to obtain that out of mercy only, which I do not hope for out of merit; what can be more plain and poſitive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the merit of good Works?</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of the Roman Church is this, that good works are meritorious, and the very cauſe of Salvation, ſo far that God ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, if he rendred not Heaven for the ſame, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:109869:150"/> ſometimes it is delivered thus, all good works done by Gods grace after the firſt Juſtification, be truly and properly meritorious, and fully worthy of everlaſting life, and that thereupon Heaven is the due and juſt ſtipend Crown or recompence, which God by his juſtice oweth to the Perſons ſo working by his grace, for he rendreth or repayeth heaven as a juſt Judge; and not only as a merciful giver, and the Crown which he payeth is not only of mercy or favour, but alſo of juſtice.</p>
               <p>And although he hath tempered the Doctrine of the Roman Church here to an inferiour allay, and ſayes that the opinion of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable unto it, (in which he obſerves his accuſtomed method of proving, preſuming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a man of ſuch great credit and truſt, that he leaves all to be taken for truth upon his own bare word) yet he hath miſt it ſo much in the cooking, that (as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s gueſts ſaid of the pottage) there is <hi>mors in olla,</hi> death in the pott, and it is no more agreeable to Pope <hi>Gregoryes</hi> Doctrine than darkneſs is to light.</p>
               <p>Becauſe his words are very remarkable I muſt crave leave of the Reader to repeat them here, the Catholick Church (ſaith he) teacheth that our beſt works in this ſtate of corrupted nature, as they are ours preciſely are not meritorious of a reward from God, becauſe we can do no good thing our ſelves as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is all from God, yet as proceeding from the grace of Chriſt working in us, and with us, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by his merits and promiſes, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a reward to them, and made them worthy of a reward.</p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:109869:150"/>
               <p>Obſerve firſt, this Gentleman ſpeaks of the beſt works of man in the ſtate of corruption, which he paſſes under a double conſideration, either as proceeding from a mans own ſelf, or as proceeding from the grace of Chriſt, working in him and with him; now he ſayes that the beſt work of man in the ſtate of corruption, as proceeding from himſelf are not meritorious of a reward, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e can do no good of himſelf, his ſufficiency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God; but the beſt works of man in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat ſtate as proceeding from the grace of Chriſt, working in and with him are elevated by Chriſt's merits and promiſes, and made worthy of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; this is the ſence of his words if there be any ſence to be found in them.</p>
               <p>And is this the Doctrine of the Roman Church, that is like unto a confuſed <hi>Chaos,</hi> compounded of nothing but repugnancies and inconſiſtencies? by the beſt works of man in the ſtate of corruption he muſt underſtand good works, or elſe he ſpeaks not to the queſtion, and it is ſtrange that good works ſhould proceed from man in that ſtate, works cannot be good, unleſs they have theſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, <hi>rectus, recta, recte,</hi> firſt the perſon that doth them muſt be <hi>rectus,</hi> truly Godly, Secondly, he muſt do <hi>recta</hi> ſuch things as are agreeble to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le. Thirdly, he muſt do them <hi>recte,</hi> in a right manner, the deeds of Hypocrites cannot be ſaid to be good, though they have never ſo great an outward ſhew of goodneſs, a bad tree cannot bring forth good fruit; and it is ſtrange likwiſe that the grace of Chriſt ſhould work in and with man in that ſtate; certainly they are regenerated in and with whom the grace of Chriſt doth work, God will not caſt his pearls unto ſwine, and give his Childrens bread unto dogs; and it is as ſtrange that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:109869:151"/> the worke of man in that ſtate ſhould be elevated by the merits of Chriſt, the benefit of his merits being applyed only to them that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>If he had ſpoken of the beſt works of man in the ſtate of regeneration, they would be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be good in ſome Meaſure, and then his term of elevation might paſs ſo far as to render them acceptable unto God, for it is the merits of Chriſt that makes the good deeds of the regenerate to be acceptable to him; but to ſay that they are made worthy, of a reward, this cannot paſs, I have told him already that the glory of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belongs only unto Chriſt; and that glory which belongs peculiarly unto him, he will not give unto Saints or good Works, or any thing elſe, in relation to which his pen hath been altogether tongue-tyed and ſtands as mute as a fiſh; it is for the ſake of the merits of Chriſt that the good works of the righteous will he rewarded, and not for the ſake of any merit, that is given to be in their good works.</p>
               <p>Obſerve ſecondly, what agreement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Doctrine, and the Doctrine of the preſent Roman Church; Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf as in the ſtate of regeneration, <hi>Si ad opus virtutis excrevero,</hi> if (ſays he) I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vertue, and in that ſtate he diſclaims and renounces all merit, relying wholly upon the mercy of God for life and Salvation; in his book of morals he expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Si de his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus diſcutimur, quis inter haec remanet ſalutis locus, quando &amp; mala noſtra pura mala ſunt, &amp; bona quae nos habere credimus pura bona eſſe, nequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam poſſunt,</hi> Greg. mor. l. 35. c. 16. if God ſhall ſtrictly examine us, what hope of Salvation is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:109869:151"/> there for us? when as our evil deeds are ſimply evil, but our good deeds which we ſuppoſe we have, cannot be ſimply good; and farther he ſayes, <hi>Sciunt quippe ſancti, qua omnis humana juſtitia injuſtitia eſſe deprehenditur, ſi divinitus diſtricte judicetur,</hi> Greg. mor. l. 21. c. 15. the Saints know that all man's righteouſneſs is found to be unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if God do ſtrictly Judge it.</p>
               <p>If Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> had maintained the Doctrine of the preſent Roman Church he muſt have uſed another kind of dialect, and expreſſed himſelf after this manner, if I do increaſe in vertue, I am fruitful in good works, which do merit at the hands of God, and growing in them, I grow by them unto eternal life, my good deeds are elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the merits and promiſes of Chriſt ſo high, that they are made worthy of a reward, therefore I need not to fear the ſtrict diſquiſition of the great Judge, but may truſt to the merit of my good deeds for obtaining eternal Salvation, but there is not the leaſt ſound to this purpoſe, the contrary being expreſſed, that it was mercy not merit, pardon not good deeds that was the ground of his hope, and the Rock of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I have not the Centuriſts to ſearch into; but this I will ſay that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> is ſo poſitive and plain in his expreſſions, that if the Centuriſts do charge him with an errour in this point, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they miſtook the meaning of his words, or elſe they muſt make him not only to contradict himſelf, but alſo to incur a more ſhameful and hateful contradiction, that is to the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the clear dictates of reaſon and to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſeveral antient Fathers.</p>

               <p>Secondly to the clear dictates of reaſon, that informs us that there cannot be any merit in the performance of an obliged duty, a debtor cannot merit at the Hands of a Creditor by paying of a due debt beſides man hath nothing of his own wherewith to diſcharge that debt, what hath he that he hath not received, and if he hath received it, why ſhould he glory as if he did not receive it? Farther the Coin that he payes in diſcharge of this debt is notaltogether pure mettal, but mixed with ſome droſs, perfection is not in this life, the beſt deeds of the beſt men have many failings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to them; moreover there is no due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between all mans good deeds (be they never ſo many) and eternal life, for if the fuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be not, much leſs are the actions of this life, worthy to be compared unto the glory that ſhall be revealed in us. Now merit requires with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109869:153"/> neceſſity (without which it cannot be) that there be a due proportion between good deeds, and the reward, and that the good deeds be pure, without any ſinful mixture, and that they be a man's own, and that they be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe free, without the obligation of a previous duty.</p>
               <p>To remove all theſe obſtacles the reflector ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes himſelf to have a ready and powerfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, good deeds (ſays he) are elevated ſo much by the merits and promiſes of Chriſt that they are made worthy of a reward; but before he had laid down this bold and groundleſs aſſertion, he ſhould firſt have proved, that the glory of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which belongs only unto Chriſt, is given to created natures; this I deny, and this he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove. Secondly, he ſhould have proved that good works are capable to receive this merit; ſurely that which is a duty, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefect, and not a mans own, and bears no ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proportion unto eternal life, cannot be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to receive any ſuch thing. Thirdly he ſhould have conſidered, that this is to divide man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Chriſt and good works, to ſay that the merit, which is pretended to be in good works, flows from the merits of Chriſt, will not excuſe this groſs abſurdity, theſe two being indifferent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and different in themſelves, and the gaining of eternal life is attributed by the Romaniſts to the one as well as to the other. Fourthly it is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous and abſurd to ſay, that though Chriſt hath merited eternal life for us, yet we muſt by good deeds merit it likewiſe at the hands of God, as it is to ſay that we have a large inheritance freely beſtowed upon us, which was purchaſed with a large ſum, and yet we muſt purchaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Fifthly, though the Romaniſts do affirm that this is ſerviceable to ſet forth the ſufficiency of the merits of Chriſt, yet really it doth produce the contrary effect, detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundantly from it. If Chriſt's merits be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, there is no need that good works ſhould be meritorious, but if that be needful, then his merits are not ſufficient; Sixthly, to maintaine this he muſt ſay that the merits of Chriſt gives unto man ability to ſatisfy for his ſins; for meriting a reward doth neceſſarily pre-ſuppoſe ſatisfaction for ſin, if there be any wrong done (as he knows that this is done by every one, every one being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſinner) the perſon meriting muſt be a perſon ſatisfying, otherwiſe there will be no obtaining by way of merit; now I hope he will not ſay that Chriſt gives unto man ability to ſatisfy for his ſins, for to ſay this is to deny the ſufficiency of that ſatisfaction which was paid by Chriſt; Seventhly, to ſay that the merits of Chriſt gives unto man's good deeds to merit a reward, is in effect to ſay that Chriſt gives unto man by his good deeds to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Contrary to all this the Romaniſts do tell us, that they have the Scripture, and reaſon, and the antient Fathers on their ſide; firſt for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in it (ſay they) eternal life is termed a reward, and this reward is promiſed to perſons that do perform good deeds, and is ſaid to proceed from juſtice; good deeds will be mentioned when the ſentence of abſolution ſhall be pronounced to the righteous by the great Judge at the laſt day; but all this ſpeaks nothing to their purpoſe, unleſs they can prove that nothing can be termed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or be promiſed, or ſaid to proceed from juſtice, but what is premerited by the receiver, which will never be done by them: Suppoſe a Servant ſo much obliged to his Maſter for former favours, that he did owe himſelf, and all that

               <p>Secondly, for the reaſons that are produced by the Romaniſts to prove the merit of good works, they are ſo miſerably infirm if not Blaſphemous, that the mention of them is a ſufficient confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is more honourable to have eternal life by merit, than by gift, thus <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus, Abſit</hi> (ſays <hi>Tapper) ut juſti vitam aeternam expectent, ſicut pauper eleemoſynam, multo namque glorioſius eſt, ipſos quaſi victores &amp; triumphatores eam poſſidere, tanquam palmam uſis ſudoribus debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> Tap. art. lev. tom. 1. art. 9.

               <p>A ſtrange inference, let the Reader take it in ſhort thus, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> forbids the Worſhiping of Pictures after any manner; therefore he agrees to the Doctrine of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which commands Images and Pictures chiefly to to be ſet up and Worſhiped with an Inferior and Relative Worſhip; this is a ſtrain of Logick, unknown to former Ages, and far above the hight that Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did fly; <hi>God took Clay and made man after his own Image and Likeneſs: Therefore</hi> (ſays Pope <hi>Adrian) we muſt ſet up Images in Churches, as we have heard, ſo have we ſeen, and God is Marvelous i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides when he Prayes to a Saint, the Worſhip that he performs unto that Saint is Divine, for Prayer is an act of Divine Worſhip, and I ask whether the Worſhip be agreeable to the Saint or not?

He then did Worſhip Pots, and Cups, and Veſtments, and other Utenſils, and might have vyed with the Heathens, for the number of thoſe Idols, which he did Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> hath told him again and again, <hi>that the end for which he allowed the uſe of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was not to be Worſhiped with any kind of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but only to Inſtruct the Ignorant, that could not read the Holy Scriptures;</hi> and if <hi>Auſtin</hi> obtruded them upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches, it was only for this end, otherwiſe he acted contrary to the Doctrine of his Maſter; and if Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Image of the Bleſſed Virgin to be carried about, it was only for this end; And though this was the only end for which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> allowed the uſe of Images and Pictures, yet was he juſtly reprehended by <hi>Calvin,</hi> becauſe this was not the method of Inſtruction that was preſcribed by God to be uſed for Edification; when our Saviour gave that Commiſſion unto his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:109869:165"/> Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Go and Teach all Nations,</hi> he did not injoyn them to carry Images about with them, to commend unto the Ignorant people for this end; and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us; <hi>That Chriſt gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and ſome Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt:</hi> He doth not tell us that he gave Images and Pictures for that purpoſe; and he affirms beſides; <hi>That Faith comes by Hearing of a Preacher,</hi> not by ſeeing of a Picture: That knowledge which is neceſſary unto Eternal Salvation cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted by Dumb and Dead Pictures and Images, but by declaring thoſe precious Truths that are delivered in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now let us obſerve, firſt how Partial this Gentlemen is in his dealing between the Sacred Scriptures, and his adored Images and Pictures: he hath declaimed againſt the uſe of the Holy Scriptures, and thrown them quite out of the doors of the common people, only for the abuſe of them: But here he will not have the uſe of Images and Pictures cryed down, though they be abuſed, but reaſons favourably in their behalf; <hi>For if</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>a good thing ſhould be taken away for the abuſe of it, we ſhould have very few good things left:</hi> It ſeems that he takes Pictures and Images for good things, while he hath an hard Sentence to paſs againſt the Holy Scriptures; for if he take them likewiſe for good things, why did he not reaſon as favourably for them? I perceive that he knows how to ſcatter Favours, or to deal Blowes for his own greater advantage; and as Malice will not forget the Carriage of an Enemy, ſo Gratitude will be mindful of the Courteſie of a

                  </gap>riend. The Sacred Scriptures are utterly againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Church and Religion, therefore deals he this hard meaſure unto them; but Images and Pictures are Superlatively Serviceable for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of their Intereſt, therefore doth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow this high reſpect upon them: But the mean while, he that extolls the merits of good works, as elevated by the Merits of Chriſt, to make man worthy of a Reward, deſerves little at the Hands of God, for preferring thoſe Senſeleſs Stocks and Stones, that have Eyes but cannot ſee, and Ears but cannot Hear, unto an higher Favour, than he can find in his Heart to beſtow upon thoſe Holy Writings, that contain the ſaving Truths, which God hath vouchſafed to impart unto his People.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he ſays, <hi>The preſent</hi> Roman <hi>Church teacheth, that it is good and lawful, and profitable to ſet up Images in Churches, and to give them a Relative Honour:</hi> But where is the proof of all this? Hath the <hi>Roman</hi> Church Taught this, and hath ſhe not produced ſome clear evidence to prove, that by this Doctrine ſhe hath taught nothing but Truth? Is it good, and is there no rule for its goodneſs? Lawful, and no Law for it? Profitable, and no profit flowing from it? If there be any, which is not mentioned? Muſt we receive all this for certain Truth, upon the bare word of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? But what if God doth Teach the contrary, whether is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, God or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Let this Gentleman look upon the ſecond Commandment, which ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged out of the Decalogue, and he may Read that the Worſhip of Images and Pictures is ſtrictly forbidden: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:109869:166"/> Image, nor the Likeneſs of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath; thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor Worſhip them,</hi> Exod. c. 20. And let him peruſe that Text which is quoted by <hi>Gregory</hi> againſt the Worſhip of Images and Pictures, <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Math. c. 4. v. 10.</p>
               <p>Theſe Commands do forbid the yeilding of any kind of Worſhip to Images and Pictures; otherwiſe the contrary to them in expreſs terms may be lawfully obſerved: And we may ſay, though God hath commanded that thou ſhalt Worſhip and ſerve him only, yet thou mayſt not Worſhip and ſerve him only, but thou mayſt Worſhip Pictures and Images, to wit, with a Relative Worſhip; though God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thou ſhalt not make any Graven Image, thou ſhalt not fall down and Worſhip them, yet thou mayſt make Graven Images, thou mayeſt fall down and Worſhip them, to wit, with a Relative Worſhip, and what kind of Laws would theſe be? How much obliging to God's People, and how likely to be obſerved? Can a Law oblige, and is it likely to be obſerved, when it is not ſufficiently and clearly propounded, when it admits of a double conſtruction, and the meaning of it is not underſtood? God hath no where made any ſpecial Proviſoes for the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Reſtriction of theſe Laws, and ſaid provided that theſe Laws be not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be againſt that Relative Worſhip, which is to be given to Images and Pictures.</p>
               <p>I ſhall let the Reflector have a further view of the nature of Image Worſhip, according as it is ſet forth in Holy Scripture; he may Read, That <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſed is the man that maketh a Graven or
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:109869:166"/> Molten Image an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> Deut. 27. 15. <hi>And Confounded be all they that ſerve Graven Images,</hi> Pſal. 97. 7. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> terms Images, <hi>A Teacher of Lyes,</hi> Hab. 2. 18. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, A Doctrine of Vanities,</hi> Jer. 10. 8. Theſe Texts do likewiſe tell us, that no that no kind of Worſhip is to be given to Images and Pictures; otherwiſe as I ſaid before, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them may be truly affirmed and juſtly maintained; and ſo the propounding of them would be nothing but a puzling of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, no direction to the Will; and inſtead of being a Light unto our Feet, and Lanthorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Paths, would be (as the Pillar of the Cloud was unto the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) utter Darkneſs to diſtract and Trouble us in the choice of our way: Let not the Reflector now ſay, (as ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have done) that theſe Commands and Texts were only Obligatory to the <hi>Jews,</hi> not pertinent to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for he may as truly ſay, that the Love of God and the Love of our Neighbours, is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent unto Chriſtians, our Saviour having told us expreſly, <hi>That on theſe two hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What if to give this Relative Worſhip to Images and Pictures be to Commit the Hainous ſin of Idolatry? What is Idolatry but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of an Idol? And what are the Images and Pictures that are Worſhiped by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> but Idols? Certainly that muſt be Idolized, to which that Worſhip is given, which is due only unto God; and it is as certain that this is done to Images and Pictures by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> the beſt Learned among them, who knew beſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and endeavoured with their whole might to maintain the pretended
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:109869:167"/> Truth of it, have determined that the Image and Picture is to have the ſame worſhip given unto it, which is to be given to the <hi>prototype,</hi> thus <hi>Aquinas, Ozorius,</hi> and others; and that manner of Image worſhip, which is preſcribed by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpeaks no leſs, <hi>Honos</hi> (ſays the Councel) <hi>Qui jis exhibetur, refertur ad prototypa, quae illae repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentant, it a ut per imagines quas oſculamur, &amp; coram quibus caput operimus &amp; procumbimus, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum adoremus, &amp; ſanctos, quorum illae ſimilitudinem gerun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the reflector thinks to avoid this Charge by ſaying that the Doctrine and the practice of the Roman Church is to forbid all Divine honour to be given to Images; while with the ſame breath he affirms the quite contrary thing, Joyning with the Romiſh Doctors, and the councel of <hi>Trent</hi> in qualifying of Image-worſhip, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative (ſays he) honour that is to be given to Images is to be agreeable to the objects which they repreſent; and what worſhip lower than divine, what worſhip but the higheſt can be agreeable unto Chriſt? If the reflectors words do admit of any ſuch thing as ſence, this muſt be it, that the worſhip which is to be given to Images, muſt be the ſame kind with that which is given to the prototypes? The ſame kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is to be given unto the Image of Chriſt, which is given unto Chriſt: As to inſtance in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:109869:167"/> worſhip, we muſt fall down, we muſt caſt our ſelves upon our bended knees unto Chriſt, and this muſt be done to the Image of Chriſt, becauſe it muſt have that worſhip given unto it, which is agreeable to the object repreſented by it. And as ſo with inward worſhip, Chriſt is to be loved, and feared, and our joy, and our truſt, and our hope is to be repoſed in him, all this is likewiſe to be done to the Image of Chriſt, that is alſo to be loved and feared, and our joy and our truſt and hope is to be repoſed in it. Becauſe it muſt have that worſhip given unto it, which is agreeable to the object, which it repreſents; let the reflector ſort this worſhip into degrees as he can, and tell (if he can) what degree it is that makes an inferiour, and what degree a ſuperiour worſhip, and preſcribe how to diſtinguiſh between them; this is certaine that by his aſſertion the ſame kind of worſhip is to be given to the Image of Chriſt, which is given unto Chriſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the worſhip that is given to his Image, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be agreeable unto him, there being a ſpeciall kind of Worſhip pertinent and due unto him.</p>
               <p>But this matter is put quite out of doubt by the notorious practice of the Romaniſts; as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto king <hi>Saul,</hi> denying his guilt of ſparing the beſt of the <hi>Amalakites</hi> cattel, what means this bleating of ſheep in my ears, and this lowing of oxen which I hear; ſo I may ſay to the Romaniſts, while they deny their guilt of Idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of Images and pictures, what means their wearing and carrying of Crucifixes and pictures about with them? What means their ſetting them up about their beds, and in their Chambers and Cloſets, and what means their burning of incenſe,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:109869:168"/> and killing, and uncovering the head, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee uſed to them, and all this is done in obedience to the dictates, and in reference to the exerciſe of their Religion; and what means their praying to Images and pictures?

                     </gap>f ſence as to believe a Stone to be</hi> Jupiter; and the Inhabitants of <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> when they ſaw <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> heal one that was a Cripple from his Youth, ſaid, <hi>The Gods are come down to us in the likeneſs of men,</hi> Acts 14. 11. they ſuppoſed their Gods to be in Heaven, whoſe Images and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they worſhipped upon Earth; it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. 23. that the <hi>Athenians</hi> worſhipped the true God, and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that this worſhip was performed by the uſe of Statues and Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ask the Romaniſts how theſe things do hang together, that God's worſhip is not given to his Image, and yet that the worſhip which is given to it, is referred unto him? will they refer that unto God which is not his? how then can they think to find acceptance? and how dare they pretend to worſhip God after this manner? The offering of ſtrange Fire coſt <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> dear, even the loſs of their precious lives. Beſides, how
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:109869:174"/> can theſe contradictory pleas excuſe them from the guilt of Idolatry? when they do worſhip the Image of God by Thurification and kiſſing, and uncovering the head, and bowing the knee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are theſe outward acts of ſubmiſſion and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence part of God's worſhip or not? if not, God is not worſhipped by them, and conſequently the Romaniſts are groſs Idolaters in directing their worſhip to meer liveleſs Stocks and Stones; but if they be, then are the Romaniſts confeſſed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in giving that unto Stocks and Stones, which is due only to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ask them what ſtrength is to be found in this inference, Images are repreſentations of Heavenly things, therefore they are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped? Are all ſuch Repreſentations to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped? why then was not the Tabernacle and the Temple worſhipped by the Jews, they were repreſentations of heavenly things? and why are not the Heavens worſhipped by Chriſtians, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us that <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy work?</hi> why is not the Sun, the Moon, and all living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yea, every Shrub and Herb worſhipped, the Poet telling us (and that nothing but Truth) <hi>Preſentem refert quaelibet Herba Deum?</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which they draw from the Cherubims, and the Brazen Serpent is as weak and ridiculous; the Romaniſts will never prove that theſe things were ſet up and commanded to be worſhipped, the contrary being expreſſed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell to worſhip the Brazen Serpent, by burning of <hi>Incenſe</hi> unto it, their carriage was ſo offenſive and abominable, that it was broken in pieces by the Godly King, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for which act he had this approbation,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109869:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> That <hi>he did that, which was right in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I will tell them that they are very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of holy Duties, and very backward in the performance of them, if they ſtand in need of the monition of Images and Pictures; and if they muſt have ſuch ſenceleſs admonitors, why muſt they be of their own making, will not ſuch as are God's own handy work ſerve their turn? But to infer hence that thoſe admonit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> are to be worſhiped with a relative worſhip, is a ſtrain of Logick that requires admiration; what goodly concluſions will this antecedent bring forth, their Ghoſtly Fathers (the Prieſts) do (as they ſay) put the common people in mind, and do ſtir them up to the performance of holy Duties, therefore they are to be worſhiped with a relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; every provident and indulgent Parent is careful to do this unto his Children, therefore he is to be worſhiped with a relative worſhip; yea, every part of the viſible Creation may and ought to be improved to this behoof, therefore every part thereof is to be worſhiped with a relative worſhip.</p>
               <p>He that is convinced with ſuch ſilly Arguments as theſe, that the worſhiping of Images and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures is good and lawful and profitable, hath his underſtanding totally eclipſed; that he ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as it is in it ſelf, but takes every thing upon truſt, as it is repreſented by the preſent Roman Church, though the nature of it be quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>That kind of worſhip can never be good and lawful and profitable, that is <hi>Firſt,</hi> not derived from the fountain of goodneſs; where did God ever injoyn or approve of the worſhipping of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:109869:175"/> Images and Pictures? He hath ſtrictly forbidden the making, and frequently prohibited and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the worſhipping of them; but never did he give the leaſt hint of an injunction, or the leaſt ſign of approbation for this worſhipping of Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That was never uſed by any of the Primitive Chriſtians; which of thoſe mentioned in Scripture, that were firſt Converted unto the Chriſtian Faith, did ever obſerve this practice? we read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their meeting together to hear the Word of God, and to pray unto him, and to praiſe him for his bleſſings; but never of their meeting together to worſhip Images and Pictures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That is not conformable to that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip, which was preſcribed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is a Spirit, and is to be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> to worſhip God by Images and Pictures, is not to worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That is not agreeable to that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was uſed by the choice Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, while they were in the World; <hi>We walk</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) by Faith, and not by ſight, and our converſation is in Heaven;</hi> to walk by the ſight of a Picture, is not to walk by Faith; and to converſe with Pictures, is not to have our converſation in Heaven.</p>
               <p>

               <p>TO be Head of the Catholick Church, is a Prerogative that is peculiar unto Chriſt; <hi>The Husband</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) is the Head of the Wife, as Chriſt is the Head of the Church:</hi> He only is capable to receive it, and he only hath Power and Ability to execute the Offices that do belong unto it; what is vain, ſinful, mortal man, that he ſhould have this capacity and ability at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto him?

This being obſerved, I proceed to examine how he maintains the Supremacy that he claims for the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Title of Univerſal Biſhop in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould <hi>Tantomount</hi> to that Title, which was given by <hi>Clement</hi> to <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem, Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum, Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines are there to be uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o rack it, to ſignify only one particular Biſhop, excluding all others from the Dignity of Biſhops? Two diſſenting terms of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:109869:178"/> different ſignifications cannot import the ſame thing, and Univerſals do not exclude, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude particulars; it is a pitiful ſhift to avoid the force of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Teſtimony, by ſheltring himſelf under a Nonſenſical diſtinction, and mark how he proves the ſeveral Members of this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>For the firſt he quotes Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> but as Millers commonly take their Toll, it is with ſome Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and (as ſome Litigious perſons do win their Tryals at Law) by teaching the Witneſſes to ſpeak more than they know: Theſe Words (<hi>as if there were no other Apoſtle but himſelf</hi>) are not Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s; who would think that the man that hath been crying out againſt me, and charging me with falſifying and wreſting Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſhould make himſelf guilty of this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful addition; and who would think that he ſhould be thus groſly Injurious to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> to charge him with an Expreſſion that contains in its ſelf a manifeſt contradiction? If <hi>Peter</hi> was the Prince of the Apoſtles, it was impoſſible that any Title of Univerſality ſhould exclude the other Diſciples from an Apoſtolick Dignity; if there had been no other Apoſtles, how could he be Prince of the Apoſtles? And who would think that he ſhould ſpeak thus contemptibly of the Power of Chriſt? It is certain that Chriſt did ordain other Apoſtles beſides St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and it was impoſſile to render that undone, which Chriſt had done, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any Title that was given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould diveſt them of that Apoſtolick Authority which was given to them by Chriſt: Becauſe this Gentleman is reſolved to be diſhoneſt in his carriage for the maintaining of his Religion, I would adviſe him to ſettle himſelf for ſome term
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:109869:178"/> of years in a Colledge of Jeſuits, that he may be inſtructed how to ſet a better Varniſh upon his Diſhoneſt practices, that they may not appear ſo groſs and notorious (as they are) to the view of the World.</p>
               <p>I can direct him to a Quotation more ſeeming for his purpoſe, without any Additional Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication or Corruption; Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> uſeth this Expreſſion, <hi>Triſte tamen valde eſt, ut patienter fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur, quatenus deſpectis omnibus, praedictus frater, &amp; coepiſcopus meus ſolus conetur appellari Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, It is very ſad that it ſhould be ſuffered patiently that my fore ſaid Brother and Fellow Biſhop deſpiſing all others, ſhould endeavour to be called the only Biſhop,</hi> Greg. l. 4. p. 34. But what ſervice can he make of this Expreſſion? Can he infer hence that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal Biſhop, only as it did Unbiſhop all others? He may as rationally and firmly conclude, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Title of Univerſal only as it did Unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch all the reſt of the Patriarchs, becauſe he ſays, <hi>Sed nullus unquam deceſſorum meorum hoc tam prophano vocabulo uti conſenſit, quia videlicet ſi unus Patriarcha univerſalis dicitur, Patriarcharum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ceteris derogatur: None of my Predeceſſors ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or he may as probably inferr that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal only as it did Unprieſt all others, becauſe he ſays, <hi>Sed nullus eorum unquam hoc ſingularitatis vocabulum aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, nec uti conſenſit, ne dum privatum aliquid da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur uni, honore debito ſacerdotes privarentur uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi:

And can we think that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal only in this ſenſe, as it did Unpatriarch all, and Unprieſt all but one.</p>
               <p>His Words muſt be taken in this ſenſe; it is very ſad that it ſhould be ſuffered patiently that my Brother and Fellow Biſhop deſpiſing all others, ſhould endeavour to be called the only Biſhop of higheſt Power and Dignity, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any other to be equal to himſelf; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this ſenſe he hath ſeveral plain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Expreſſions: <hi>What wilt thou Anſwer</hi> (ſays he unto <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople) unto Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Head of the Church at that day of Judgment, who endeavoureſt to ſubject all his Members to thy ſelf by a Title of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> Greg. l. 4.

               </p>
               <p>It is evident that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal Biſhop, in that ſenſe in which it was offered to him; and his Predeceſſor by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and in which it was uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urped by <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> he writes to the Emperor <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and to <hi>Eulogius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and likewiſe to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to this purpoſe; <hi>Sicut enim veneranda veſtra

Epiſt. 32, &amp; 36, &amp; 38. And can we think that the Biſhops aſſembled in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> would beſtow a Title that would Unbiſhop themſelves; or that the Biſhops Aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urpation of that Title, which would caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down from their Office and Dignity.</p>
               <p>While he ſays that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of Univerſal Biſhop only as it did exclude all others from the Dignity of Biſhops, obſerve how conſiſtent he is with himſelf; in his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he vents this Expreſſion, <hi>To bring which about he will make Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npope himſelf, a ſhrewd diſpleaſure I promiſe you, and far more Cruel than</hi> John <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>who oppoſed Pope</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory; <hi>for though he ſtood in contention with Pope</hi> Gregory, <hi>yet he never endeavoured to make him act this Cruelty upon himſelf:</hi> It is notoriouſly known that the ground of their contention was the Title that <hi>John</hi> uſurped, and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as Proud, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe words inſtead of proving his Aſſertion, do directly prove the contrary; Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> doth not declare himſelf to be Supream, and above all others, but acknowledgeth in others an equality to himſelf, if there were any fault to be found in Biſhops, he ſays the faulty Biſhops were ſubject unto him, but how? not as Biſhops, but as criminous, to be admoniſhed, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and cenſured by him; which ſubjection was not an Argument of any Supremacy in him; equals (if there be any faulty) are ſubject to be admoniſhed and reprehended and cenſured by one another.

               <p>If Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> did claim a ſupremacy above all, he ſpeaks very much below himſelf, when he made application to the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> calling him Lord and Maſter, and profeſſing his humble ſubmiſſion to him with his cap in his hand, <hi>Vobis obedientiam prebere deſidero, I deſire to yield obedience to your ſelf,</hi> Greg. 4. ep. 32. ind. 1. 3.

               <p>Thirdly, How can the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſors?

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:109869:186"/> given unto me, they gave me the right hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that we ſhould go unto the Heathen, and they unto the Circumciſion,</hi> Gal. 2. v. 9. The Fourth year after the Death of Chriſt, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> about thirteen years after the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> conferred with him there, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was at the Synod, when the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about Circumciſion was determined; he preached the Goſpel in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> he lived and preached in <hi>Babylon;</hi> all this while we do not read that ever he was at <hi>Rome;</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> was there, is evident from the Holy Scripture, but to prove <hi>Peter's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, there is not one ſyllable in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be found.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſtrange that in all thoſe Epiſtles that <hi>Paul</hi> writ from <hi>Rome;</hi> and in that Epiſtle which he writ to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he makes mention of ſeveral Friends and Servants of God, there is no mention made of the name of <hi>Peter:</hi> where was <hi>Peter</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> made mention of <hi>Ariſtarchus, Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Juſtus,</hi> and ſays of them, that they only were his Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom of God? <hi>Col. 4. v. 11. Paul</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> then, but certainly <hi>Peter</hi> was not there, otherwiſe without doubt <hi>Paul</hi> would have reckoned him in the number of his fellow-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And where was <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid that at his firſt appearance before <hi>Nero,</hi> no man ſtood with him, but all men forſook him? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. v. 16. Muſt we ſay that <hi>Peter</hi> was fled from <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:109869:186"/> certainly, had <hi>Peter</hi> been there, he would have ſtood with <hi>Paul.</hi> Theſe things cannot conſiſt with that Relation which is made by <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and ſate there five and twenty years; nor alſo with that other ſtory, that both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered Martyrdome in the ſame place, at the ſame time, and under the ſame perſecuting Emperour: againſt theſe Reports, we ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Teſtimony of that ancient Father, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> that <hi>Linus</hi> was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after him ſucceeded <hi>Anacletus,</hi> and in the third place the Succeſſion fell to <hi>Clemens,</hi> not mentioning <hi>Peter</hi>'s being there, and denying that he was the firſt Biſhop that was ſeated there.</p>
               <p>But however, if <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the firſt Biſhop that ſate there, this cannot make all the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to be his true and lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours: I ask the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in what all the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded him?

               <p>Becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do build ſo much upon this Succeſſion from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and would have the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to be his true and lawful Succeſſours, to conclude thence that the Pope is the Head of the Church, and do make this a chief Article of their Faith; affirming peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, That to be within the compaſs of his Juriſdiction, to be obedient unto him, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, I would have the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to tell me, which was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, when <hi>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> might be ſaid to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s true and lawful Succeſſours, yet the Title of Supremacy was not due unto them; if it was not due unto St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is certain that it was not due unto them; but for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of this, if it was their due, how could the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> offer it to Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and his immediate Predeceſſour, as a free-gift? Did Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Predeceſſour want their due, until the Seſſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109869:189"/> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> or did the Council of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> offer that unto them which they had before? And how could the Council offer that as a free-gift, (as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> terms it) which was a Due belonging unto them? And how could that be a Due belonging unto them, which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be uſed? Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us plainly, <hi>That the Title of Supremacy, which was the matter of contention between him and</hi> John <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>and which was offered to him and his Predeceſſour, by the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of the Goſpel, and to the Decrees and Canons of the Church: Greg. l. 4. Epiſt. 32. &amp; 34. &amp;</hi> 36. And I hope this Gentleman will grant that it was therefore unlawful to be uſed.</p>
               <p>But for a farther diſcovery, let us inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the practices of former Ages, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did yield any ſuch thing as the Title of Supremacy to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a Due belonging unto them; ſeveral Popes have been Excommunicated, ſeveral depos'd; Appeals unto <hi>Rome</hi> were ſtrictly forbidden by the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice: Con.

Emperours have exerciſed the Power and Authority of Summoning and Confirming General Councils, and the Pope with his Hat in his Hand and his Knee in the Duſt, hath ſupplicated the Emperour to employ his Authority in calling of Councils: To this purpoſe Pope <hi>Leo</hi> writ unto the Clergy and People of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, <hi>Expoſcite ut petitioni noſtrae qua plenariam indici Synodum poſtulamus clementiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus imperator dignetur annuere: Make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that the Emperorurs Majeſty would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grant my humble Petition, wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to Summon a general Council.</hi> I could inſtance in ſeveral other particulars, but theſe may ſerve to let this Gentleman ſee that the practice of former Ages did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Supremacy to belong unto the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:109869:190"/>
               <p>How can this Title be derived unto them, if this Gentleman ſhall ſay, that it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by our Saviour upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> in order to Succeſſion, that whoſoever ſhould be ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Chair, was to be immediately poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of it, as his own undoubted inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance lineally and legally deſcending upon him; Firſt I ſay, that it hath been already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that our Saviour never inveſted St. <hi>Peter</hi> with a greater dignity and power than he gave to the reſt of his Diſciples. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I ask how it came to paſs, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages were altogether ignorant of this Deed of Entail? Had the Biſhops aſſembled in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> known it, they would not have been ſo ſimple as to offer it freely unto the Pope upon this ground of Succeſſion from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is folly in the abſtract to pretend to beſtow that as a free-gift, which is paſſed before as an unqueſtionable inheritance. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſay this, is a Blaſphemous detraction from that ſpecial providence, and tender reſpect, which Chriſt beares unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſeveral Popes have been wicked Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; ſeveral extreamly Vitious, ſeveral Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, ſeveral have climbed up into the Papal Chair by indirect and wicked means; ſome by Symony, ſome by Sedition, ſome by Tyranny, ſome by Deceit, ſome by Murder; of <hi>Bonni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> VIII. it is ſaid, <hi>Intravit ut vulpes, regna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:109869:190"/> ut Lupus, mortuus eſt ut Canis: That he entred into the Popedom as a Fox, he reigned as a Wolfe, and died as a Dog, Char. ſum. p.</hi> 432.

Can we think that our Saviour foreknowing theſe things, would make this proviſion for his Church, to ſettle the Supremacie to be poſſeſſed, and leave his Church, which he purchaſed with his deareſt Blood, to be ruled and inſtructed in the great concern of Salvation, by ſuch miſhapen and filthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; experience tells us, that if the Eyes be blind, the whole body is in darkneſs, and if the head be diſeaſed, the body languiſheth; and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> affirms, that one reaſon why the Title of Supremacy was to be rejected, was this, <hi>Si unus Epiſcopus vocatur univerſalis, univerſa Eccleſia corruit, ſi unus univerſus cadit, If one be called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop, in the fall of that one, the whole Church is ruined, Greg. l. 6. Epiſt.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Now let us admire the Candour, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of this Gentleman, how little the one, and how great the other is, in ſaying, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> pleads his own Right, and that the Title was due only to himſelf, as being choſen Head of the Church, and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that he complains grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly of the Injuries done unto him by <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in uſurping
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:109869:191"/> the Title of Univerſal, and robbing the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> of it; how could <hi>John</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> rob the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> of that which they never had?

                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:109869:191"/> (as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays) did endeavour (as all the late Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have done) to ſubjugate all thoſe unto himſelf, which belong only to one Head, which is Chriſt: Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s words are theſe: <hi>Ita ut univerſa ſibi ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet adſcribere, &amp; omnia quae ſoli uni capiti co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, videlicet Chriſto, per elationem pompatici Sermonis ejuſdem Chriſti ſibi ſtudeat membra ſubjugare: He ſtrives to aſcribe all unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and all the Members which do agree in one only Head, to wit, Chriſt, he endeavours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto himſelf, by the elation of a pompous Title, Greg. l. 4. Epiſt.</hi> 36. And farther, if Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had pleaded his own Cauſe, and complained of any Injury done unto himſelf, more than unto others; he would not, as he did, blame <hi>Eulogius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for aſcribing unto him the Title of Univerſal, as it was offered unto the Pope by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> forbidding the uſe of it in relation to himſelf, or unto any other, <hi>Greg. l. 7. Epiſt.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>I have written more largely in Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this unjuſt Claim, which is made by the late Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Title of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becauſe it is (as ſome <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do affirm) the very Pinnacle of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Temple, that which is cryed up, and contended for, and expoſed moſt to view, on purpoſe to ſerve (as a great Sea-mark) to direct unwary and unskilful Paſſengers to ſteer their courſe into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> harbour; and as
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:109869:192"/> ſome do ſay, it is the foundation ſtone, upon which all the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Structure is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whither ſhould the Members reſort, but where the Directive Faculty reſides, and that is in the Head? And why muſt the Saints be invocated, and Images Worſhipped, and the dead be prayed for, and the reſt of their Superſtitious and Idolatrous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be embraced and practiſed, but becauſe they are dictated by the Head, and the Pope (as is affirmed by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) is that Head? which being diſproved, it is evident that the Headſhip which is claimed, is nothing but a meer <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> to draw the ignorant and unwary out of the way; and the foundation being ſhaken and deſtroyed, the whole building falls to the ground; the Dictates of the Pope, that are not expreſſed in the Holy Scripture, nor neceſſarily and by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence deduced thence, have no more Truth in them, than there is in this poſition, That the Pope is the Head of the Church; and there is no more Truth in that, than there is in this, That every particular Patriarch, or every particular Biſhop, is the Head of the Church.</p>
               <p>For a Concluſion, I ſhall deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice, what Pope it was that firſt uſurped the Title of Supremacy, and at whoſe hands he received, and by what means he attained this great Dignity: It was <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the III. who with much labour and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:109869:192"/> and bribery, procured a Grant of it from that Tyrannical Uſurper <hi>Phocas;</hi> who being a Souldier, rebelled againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Emperour <hi>Mauritius, Abb. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſp. in Mau.</hi> and moſt cruelly and wickedly put him him to Death, the manner of which was this: Firſt he commanded forth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Sons, and cauſed them to be Slain, and afterward the Empreſs, the Emperour all the while lamentably beholding that ſad ſpectacle, and pouring out his Complaint unto God, ſaying, <hi>Lord thou art juſt, and juſt is thy Judgment.</hi> Laſt of all he acted the like But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery upon the Emperour, laying him, his Wife, and Children, all together on an heap, <hi>Car. in chro. Greg. l. 11. Epiſt 1. jud.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>During the Reign of this bloody Uſurper, God ſeemed utterly to withdraw his Bleſſings from the Empire; <hi>France, Spain, Germany, Lombardy,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Eaſt fell from it for ever; after he had Reigned a while, and committed ſundry Murders, with many other great miſchiefs, the People laid violent hands upon him, and ſlew him, and caſt his dead Body into the Fire; loe, this was he that firſt advanced the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Head of the Univerſal Church.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly</hi> what fabrick he hath erected upon that foundation, which he terms ſomewhat more certain, that is the teſtimony of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory?</hi> Inſtead of building upon it, he hath razed it quite, and laid aſide not only Pope <hi>Gregory's,</hi> but alſo all the antient fathers, by ſaying (as he doth) treating upon the communion in both kinds, <hi>That unleſs I do produce a command or ſhew a neceſſity for receiving the Sacrament in both kinds, without which it could not be entire, I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, though I ſhall produce a
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:109869:194"/> thouſand clear and undeniable teſtimonys out of Pope</hi> Gregory, <hi>or any one elſe, witneſſing that the laity had received under both kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> what arguments he hath uſed to prove that my expreſſions concerning <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Monk do not hang together? May he not be ſuppoſed to be inſtrumental in converting of the Saxons, and notwithſtanding be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe faults, of which Hiſtoricall writers do report him to be guilty? Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays that many will plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the laſt day; ſaying, Lord have we not Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works, which notwithſtanding will be anſwered with a <hi>revera neſcio vos, verily I know you not;</hi> if he was a Monk of great vertue, yet queſtionleſs, he had failings as well as others; and if he was proud and ambitious and cruel, yet he might be an Inſtrument in the hand of the ſupream agent for the converſion of Pagans. I hope this Gentleman will not aſcribe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and efficacy of converſion to the inſtrument, but will acknowledge that it reſides in, and Iſſues from the ſupream agent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> where are thoſe evident proofs to be found which are taken out of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> by which he hath cleared his opinion and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in the particulars mentioned, he doth agree with the Doctrine of the Roman Church, and directly oppoſe the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> There is not one proof produced by him out of this antient Father in relation to any particular, excepting only two concerning the Pope's ſupremacy, the one made with a ſhameful addition, the other with a deceitfull mutilation.</p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:109869:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> what are the names of thoſe Proteſtant writers, by whoſe confeſſion and teſtimony he hath ſhewed that the Doctrine and belief of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> in every one of the particulars, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Doctrine of the Roman Church? There is not one Proteſtant writer quoted by him in relation to moſt of the particulars, as to the canon of the Scripture, the ſufficiency of the ſcripture, the reading of the ſcripture the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both kinds, the Pope's ſupremacy; and thoſe, that are quoted by him in relation to the reſt, ſpeak not one word directly to any particular, therefore what they ſay (as I have ſhewed) is nothing ſerviceable for the Romaniſts; excepting only the centuriſts, who ſpeak to good works, unto which an anſwer hath been given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> what ground he hath for thoſe hideous concluſions which he maks againſt me, ſaying my method hath been inconcluſive; my arguments weakneſs of reaſon, and my reaſon inconſequent; and what reaſon he had to charge me with open contradictions, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed interpretations, and inexcuſable falſifications, and puſling the reader with wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>-cavils, and exceptions? And I muſt ask him where thoſe numerous faults, and many errours, that he objects againſt me in the general, are to be found? And why they are lapped up from ſight in a cloud of generals, and not any one mentioned in particular.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen two Champions marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the field, the one who was the challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, filling the aire with a loud Robuſtious noiſe, and loading the other with many bitter invectives, threatening to cut collops of fleſh out of his body in ſatisfaction for the Injury, that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:109869:195"/> was done, whereas by the evidence of ſeveral witneſſes there was no occaſion of offence giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; the other paſſed along without making many words, only he proteſted that there was not any Injurious carriage uſed by him; but being that the challenger was ſo hot and heavy in his ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lamations and invectives, he was content to run the hazard of a duell, to prove his own Innocency, and to try, whether the Challenger's ſword was as ſharp as his tongue.</p>
               <p>When the rampant gallant perceived that he could not by his thundring words frighten the other to a ſubmiſſion, he was eaſily perſwaded to let the quarrel fall, without any farther deciſion, and both retreated without bloodſhed. From the obſervation of all this, I drew theſe concluſions, that great brags are no certain ſigns of true valour, nor high words demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative arguments of great performances, nor confident accuſations an evidence of guiltineſs in the perſon accuſed: I leave the reader to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how like this Gentleman is unto that rampant gallant; and will now perform my promiſe to acquaint the reader with thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall letters, which paſſed betwixt me and Mr. <hi>H.

                     </opener>
                     <p>AT my coming to <hi>Stoniherſt,</hi> I found a Letter of yours, which had laid there for ſome time expecting my return, wherein you tell me that you hear, I have a purpoſe to Vindicate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerned in your Papers: Truly Sir, why I ſhould put my ſelf upon the Vindication of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:109869:196"/> one, whom I neither know in Perſon or in Quality, I cannot give any Rational account; for if the perſon concerned thought himſelf not at all obliged, nor it worth his labour to proceed any further in it; I hope no one in reaſon can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from me.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe I am always ready to Vindicate, when in reaſon and diſcretion it is required, and to endeavour your ſatisfaction as much as poſſibly I can, if I find you deſirous to receive it: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Diſputes are ſubject to many affected miſtakes, Miſ-interpretations of the ſenſe, Wordiſh Cavils and Quibbles, too much below a man, much leſs a Scholar, the one often times wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framing a quite different ſenſe from what the other intended, by which means the thing in Controverſy is induſtriouſly rendred more difficult, and obſcure than before, by crowding in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of words, ſo to puſle and amuſe the weaker ſort of people, with petty exceptions, and meer Cavils: I would have you therefore to believe, that I am as far from ſeeking to concern my ſelf in any thing that looks like unto a perſonal Quarrel, or hath ſo much of the place of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conteſt as your hath, as I was at firſt from deſiring your Papers, otherwiſe than that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Challenge, and Reſolution to Print them, in caſe I did not Anſwer them, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my ſelf obliged both in Civility and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſave you both the Labour and Charges, although I am not ignorant that new Opinions (though never ſo weak, and untrue) rather gain than looſe repute and ſtrength by oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what they want of in Truth and Reaſon, they are but too apt to be ſupplied with by Paſſion. <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſay not this for that I conceive there is any
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:109869:196"/> thing in your Written Book, which hath ſo much as the appearance of a real difficulty, but becauſe I have not the Itching Humour of Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and entring into Diſputes, where nothing but Quibbles, Animoſities, Heats and Paſſions are likely to be the Iſſue in a wilderneſs of ſuch Talk, and wilful affected miſtakes; for I do not ſee what other can be expected from your method and way of proceeding by any Diſcreet and Impartial Conſiderer of your Papers, but that inſtead of bringing your Controverſy to an end, you will render it more confuſed and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs than you found it. And really <hi>Sir,</hi> ſhould I find you ſo moderate and ſincerely diſpoſed, as to oblige me to a little further pains in Studying your ſatisfaction either in theſe particulars, or any elſe; I aſſure you, I ſhould be ſo far from doing it to make you an Adverſary, that I would not ſo much as think of it with any other intention, but to make you more a Friend, and to convince you likewiſe how much I am.</p>

                     <p>YOu Charge my Papers, and you double your Charge, with a tendency to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and endleſs conteſts, and with a guilt of Perſonal Quarrelling, therefore you will not write againſt them: Beſides, you add this reaſon,

Addition, ſaying, <hi>That you have not the Itching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humour of Scribling and entring into Diſputes, where nothing but Quibbles, Animoſities, Heats, Paſſions, are likely to be the Iſſue in a Wilderneſs of ſuch Talk, and wilful and affected miſtakes:</hi> It ſeems this Charge is likewiſe brought againſt my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, otherwiſe there can be no Validity in your reaſon; for if my Papers be not ſtained with that Guilt, you may attempt the confutation of them without the danger of thoſe formidable Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
                     <p>Pray <hi>Sir,</hi> let me ask you why you did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome reaſon for your Charge? It may be ſuppoſed that my Antagoniſt and you ſucked both one Milk, becauſe you are ſo much alike in charging, and it is well if you prove not both alike in carrying on your Charge: After I demanded a reaſon of his Charge, I heard not from him ſince unto this day; and now I demand a reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for your Charge, but do fear that I ſhall never hear more from you.</p>
                     <p>And while you bring this Injurious Charge againſt my Writings, how much you do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect againſt my perſon, I leave to your own Judgment to determine; Writings are <hi>Judices animi</hi> as much as any thing, I muſt then be a <hi>Scribler, a Quibbler, addicted to affected Miſtakes, Miſ-interpretation of Senſe, Wordiſh Cavils, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Quarrels, confuſed and endleſs Conteſts, and therefore not fit to live in any Chriſtian Society:</hi> But my comfort is that your Sayings are not Oracles; you Talk of Diſcretion and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                     <p>And being that you have taken ſo much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to repreſent me to my ſelf without reaſon out of my Papers, be not offended, if I take ſome liberty to repreſent you to your ſelf out of your Letter, with reaſon, though I dare not preſume to determine of the end you aim at in writing of it, becauſe you ſeem to me <hi>Penelopes Telas texere,</hi> to do and undo: Yet I dare affirm,</p>

                     <p>In the next place your reaſon runs ſo low, that it was wiſely done to make your confidence blow high, that the ſound of your great words might be ſerviceable to ſupply the Emptineſs of your Arguments, otherwiſe the man that never langhed before, would ſmile in his ſleeve to hear the relation of them: Your firſt, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is founded upon two reall entityes; to compleat it, you muſt either ſay that all two reall entityes are diviſible, or ſome two reall entityes are diviſible, if you ſay the firſt, you are required to prove what you ſay, what art have you to divide between the divinity and humanity of Chriſt; If you ſay the ſecond, then I ſay, <hi>a Particularibus nihil concluditur,</hi> and I would have you to prove that the perſon and the cauſe are two of theſe ſome; they are relative entityes, and the Logitian tells you that <hi>Relata ſunt ſimul natura,</hi> What art have you to divide between ſuch? Can you divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father and the ſon as they are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives? Certainly if there be a paternity, there muſt needs be a filiation; and if there be a
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:109869:203"/> filiation there muſt needs be a paternity; and what is done for the one is done for the other; if you prove the one to be legitimate, you prove the other to be legitimate; and if you prove the one to be noble, you prove the other to be noble, thus the perſon and the cauſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, if you vindicate the cauſe, you will vindicate the perſon maintaining that cauſe, and if you vindicate the perſon maintaining that cauſe, you will vindicate that cauſe; but why do I trouble my ſelf with that wounderfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it being an <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the things in queſtion; the queſtion is not whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the cauſe be diviſible, but whether you can divide between them, being that you undertook to anſwer my papers; and you may as well ſay that frigidity is calidity, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is Indiviſibility, as take upon you to do this, open your eyes, and look upon my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I told you that I heard, you had a purpoſe to vindicate the perſon concerned in my papers; it is not a perſon divided from my papers, but a perſon tyed to my papers, and ſo to the cauſe controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Your Second argument grounded upon a ſuppoſition is Couſin-german<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the firſt, being as tuneable to the thing in queſtion as an harp is to an harrow, you are not to ſpeak of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:109869:203"/> without any relation to the cauſe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the cauſe, and thus much might ſerve to reſiſt the fierceneſs of it, but yet to anſwer yours with other ſuppoſitions firſt, ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay that you were very hard ſet for an argument when you uſed this, if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſandy, the ſuperſtructure falls, if your ſuppoſition be falſe, the argument builded upon it, of its ſelf goes to ruine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe it be true that I feigned an Antagoniſt, do you think that in vindicating that Antagoniſt, you would have vindicated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a chimericall being? Will you believe your own eyes? Did you not ſee a reall writing; and ſure you will not ſay that a reall writing did proceed from a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a reall effect muſt needs have a reall cauſe, therefore this feigned Antagoniſt muſt not be a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> but a real writer, and all that you can ſay of him is that he was a counterfeited Friend to the cauſe, masked under a feigned name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suppoſing the impoſſibility that you ſpeak of, that a perſon may be vindicated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to any cauſe, this certainly is an impoſſibility, for there muſt be a cauſe in which to vindicate the perſon, otherwiſe the vidicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be an effect of a wonderfull Artificer, that can build an houſe without a foundation, what aſſurance would you have for the reality of the perſon; a writing under hand is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to work this aſſurance, and all other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances being to paſs unto your underſtanding by the conveyance of the outward ſences, are as liable to exception and doubtfulneſs as the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a reall writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:109869:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> that you cannot be aſſured at all; truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you cannot vindicate a perſon but it muſt be in relation to ſome cauſe, nor a cauſe but you muſt vindicate ſome perſon, for want of that prudential aſſurance, which you do ſpeak of; I believe that you will be ſo prudent, as not to undertake the vindication of the Cauſe, or the perſon concerned in my Papers; nor of any other perſon or cauſe whatſoever, where you are like to meet with oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To Anſwer the reaſon you do give, why I ſhould rather approve of your Irrational Expreſſion, than except againſt it: Suppoſe I ſhould ſay that the Cauſe in Controverſy is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and if you do vindicate the Cauſe, you vindicate all thoſe perſons; why then muſt my Antagoniſt be excluded, he being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and in <hi>England?</hi> And how if I ſay, that in vindicating that Cauſe, you would oppoſe all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> how muſt I be excluded out of the compaſs of that oppoſition, being a <hi>Proteſtant?</hi>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:109869:204"/> Arguments: When you have Beſotted the World into this Opinion, and peſwaded all to the practice of it, I preſume you will be a Writer of Controverſies: <hi>If the reſt of my Letter be like unto this, againſt which you have directed all your Forces, you are to be commended for being weary and deſiring to be at reſt: Abner</hi> was weary of Fighting with <hi>Joab,</hi> when he cryed out, <hi>Shall the Sword devour for ever;</hi> but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you know the reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>Now if you be like unto your <hi>quondam</hi> ſelf, I expect to receive a Furious Charge of Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but am content to ſtand out the Storm, and (if you pleaſe to heed me) will give you the reaſon, why I Fight you after this manner: Truly Sir, you look ſo contemptibly on my Papers, that I apprehended you to be ſome <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> that Scornes to enter the Liſts with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, and I have made uſe of this Sling, and this Stone, (that which you call Cavilling) to keep you at greater diſtance, leſt coming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of your mighty Spear, I mean your invinceable Arguments, I had been cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pieces.</p>

               <p>Obſerve 1. THe Office and duty belonging to a Patronage (as the Notation of the Word doth tell us) is to be an Advocate, to plead in the behalf of the Church, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity requires; to protect and defend the Church, to provide for it, to cheriſh and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, to take care that its Endowments be not alienated or diminiſhed; in a word (according to the expreſſion of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to be a nurſing Father, and a nurſing Mother unto it; if all this be not done, but the contrary acted, the Title is groſly miſapplied and abuſed, <hi>The

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. According to this, the practice of former Generations has been conformed: that their <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> did Endow the Church with a <hi>Competency</hi> of Glebes, Rents, Tithes, and Revenues, is clearly demonſtrated by the Records of Ordination, by the large bounds of the Pariſh, the ſeveral Chappels within its bowels, the largeneſs of the Manſion-Houſe that was erected for the uſe and benefit of the incumbent; which though it be in a great part demoliſhed, and the remaining part ſits <hi>Solitary,</hi> mourning in ragged, clouted, and tattered Garments, yet there are ſome Ruines and Rubbiſh, ſome Patches and Pieces viſible, to prove that it was ſometime <hi>Handſomly, Splendidly,</hi> and <hi>Richly Attired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To prevent (if it was poſſible) the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine of future Ages, our Religious Anceſtors did ſettle and ſecure the Churches Endowments with the ſtricteſt <hi>Tye</hi> and <hi>Knot</hi> that their diſcretion could invent, their Charters and Deeds of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and Donation running in this Tenor (with dreadful Anathema's and Execrations) <hi>Let his Name not, and his memory periſh from the face of the Earth; Curſed let him be in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Eſtate and Poſterity; Curſed let him be in this World, and in the World to come, that ſhall attempt to alienate or diminiſh any part of that which is dedicated and given to the Churche's uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not doubt but there are <hi>many worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> in the Nation, who wiſh well unto the Church, earneſtly deſiring its Proſperity, whoſe Zeal and Piety; and Bounty leads them to tread
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:109869:211"/> in, the ſteps of their Religious Anceſtors, and therefore are ſo far from thinking to alienate or diminiſh, that they take care and contrive to augment the Churches Revenues.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Obſerve</hi> 4. How contrary to this, is the practice of that Patronage which is concerned in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the forementioned Letters; <hi>O tempora, O mores,</hi> times and things are changed, and ſome perſons degenerated from former Generations; where the ſtately Oak did ſtand, comes up the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Shrub; and where the fruitful Vine did flouriſh, ſprings the Bramble and Thorne; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, graſping, preying perſons poſſeſs the room of thoſe that cheriſhed and nouriſhed the Church under their wings, and fed it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly with the milk of their own Breaſts.</p>
               <p>Truth may be ſpoken without juſt occaſion of offence, and nothing ſhall be declared, but what is confirmed by Tradition, living Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and too ſenſible, and very woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; greatneſs and riches are not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do evil, more than the loweſt degree of poverty; and when the Church cryes out for help to be vindicated and free from Rapine and Spoiling, the Tongue is not to be ſtruck dumb with fear, ſin is to be reproved though it dwell in a Mannor-houſe.</p>
               <p>The Church is like unto the man that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho;</hi> thoſe two Fatal Enemies and Grand Robbers (Sacriledge and Simony) have ſtript her, wounded her, and left her half dead, and there is none that takes pitty upon her, to bind up her wounds, to pour in Oyl and Wine, and to take care for her Recovery: The Mother Churches that ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:109869:211"/> the Wings and Patronage of the Pious and Learned Biſhops are (according to the Gracious Command of our Dread Soveraign) largely and competently augmented in their Revenues: But the Mother Church that lyes under the preſſure of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Patronage, continues Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in its Forlorn and Languiſhing condition.</p>
               <p>To know more particularly by what ſad fate and method the Church was brought thus low; obſerve 5. That the Patronage concerned in the Letters, is ſo greedy to ſwallow the Churches Revenues, that (having the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a conſiderable Benefice) it required for a preſentation no leſs than two parts of three to be paid yearly during the Incumbents Life; but this kind of Trading being rejected, afterwards a Gobbet of a Thouſand Pound was contracted to be paid, and had been (without ſtop or ſtrain) ſwallowed, had not the tediouſneſs of bartering afforded a Gentleman opportunity to ſtep in upon another's account, and to carry the Benefice away from the Bartering Merchants: But to ſpeak nearer to the concern of the Letters, this Patronage having purchaſed a great part of that large Portion which was in the poſſeſſion of the Abbot and Covent (as Tythes ſmall and great) and (as it is reported) the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Book, at a low, inconſiderable, and ſhameful rate; that Fat Morſel did not Satiate the Hungry Maw, but there was a continual Gaping and Snatching at that Portion which always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Church, ſo that for ſeveral turns upon a Vacancy, there was not any preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, but what was obtained by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Simonia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Several Addreſſes have been made with much importunity, begging earneſtly (for peace ſake) this reaſonable Condeſcenſion, (the beſt method for deciding of Controverſies) that two or four indifferent and Diſcreet perſons might be Selected to view the Writings, hear the Pleas, and conſider the Evidences on both ſides, and according to the beſt weight to ſway the ballance, that if it appear to them (which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent unto all) that there is Injury done unto the Church, they might order a proportionable Reparation to be made; but the inflexible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage (confiding not in the ſtrength of its Cauſe, but the weight of the Purſe) hath utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected all Addreſſes, and will hearken to no propoſalls; only that tedious and Chargable method of the Law (which is moſt in uſe for ending of Controverſies) muſt be uſed, which the Indigent Incumbent is not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Is it not ſtrange that the Patronage (but that it is <hi>Romiſh</hi>) ſhould thus forget its Office and Duty, to act quite contrary to the import of the word; that inſtead of a Nurſing Mother, it ſhould become a Cruel Stepdame, and inſtead of a Liberal Benefactor, an Unſatiable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, practiſing contrary to the Law of God, and the Light of Nature, and doing that which is abhorred by ſuch as have no other conduct but the Glimmerings of innate and naked Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, violating the Will and Teſtament of the Dead, and Converting what was given by Zealous Donors for the advancement of Piety, to Secular (if not to Prophane) uſes: And is it not ſtrange likewiſe that a purchaſe of large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues comparatively for (almoſt) nothing, ſhould not ſatisfie the Appetite of the Patronage, but it muſt be ſo greedy as to Prey upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Church.</p>
               <p>And in this Caſe is not juſt that the Law of Retaliation ſhould be put in Execution, that the Patronage might receive according to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which it hath meted; not only to be forced to reſtore the Revenues, which have been Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly and Simoniacally alienated from the Church, and to repair the loſs of the mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but alſo to be compelled to ſit down as content with an equal Alienation from its ſhameful purchaſe: Nay, becauſe the Patronage required two parts of three for a Preſentation, is it not juſtice and equity that it ſhould be compelled to be content with one part of three as ſufficient for its purchaſe, eſpecially conſidering that a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration was not payed for the tenth part of the Revenues which are poſſeſſed.</p>
